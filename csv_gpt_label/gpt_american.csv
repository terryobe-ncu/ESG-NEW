our work began years ago making the transition to sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity at our offices retail stores and data centers,"[0, 20, 25]"
which we achieved in 2018andin2020 we reached the milestone of being carbon neutral for our corporate operations including direct emissions as well as business travel and employee commute,[25]
our10 year climate roadmap is addressing apples carbon footprint through five pillars,[13]
low carbon design we will design products and manufacturing processes to be less carbon intensive through thoughtful material selection increased material efficiency and greater product energy efficiency,[24]
energy efficiency we will increase energy efficiency at our facilities and in our supply chain by finding opportunities such as retrofitting to reduce energy use,[24]
renewable electricity we will continue to source 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities and transition our entire supply chain to100 percent clean renewable sources of electricity,"[24, 17]"
direct emissions abatement we will reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in our facilities and our supply chain through process innovation emissions abatement and the use of non fossil based low carbon fuels,"[13, 25, 17]"
carbon removal working in parallel with our emissions reduction efforts we will scale up investments in carbon removal projects including nature based solutions that protect and restore ecosystems around the world,[13]
to reduce the carbon footprint of our products we are increasing efficiency and transitioning to materials from recycled sources and those made using low carb on energy in2021we continued to improve the carbon efficiency of the integrated circuits we use in our products components we have prioritized because they are carbon intensive for example switching to the apple m1chipforthe13inch macbookpro reduced the energy needed to manufacture and use the device driving down the products carbon footprint by over 8 percent,"[13, 15, 25]"
100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of a number of products all ipad models in our line up now use100 percent recycled aluminum in their enclosures joining apple watch series 7applewatchse macbook air mac mini and the 14inchand16inch macbookpro devices for products released in 2021 that had enclosures made with primary aluminum we,"[15, 19]"
to minimize the carbon footprint of our products we seek to create less waste in the processing of materials reduce machining time and the associated energy used more efficiently transform material into the shapes we need and maximize recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap,"[13, 18, 25]"
prioritized the use of aluminum smelted using low carbon sources of electricity rather than fossil fuels for a lower carbon impact these changes alone have decreased the carbon emissions associated with our use of aluminum by68percentsince2015,[25]
we are focused on using less energy across our operations beginning with how we design operate and maintain our facilities and we continue these same efforts into our supply chain which benefits the communities where our suppliers operate drawing less energy from electrical grids many of which still rely heavily on fossil fuels helps reduce local air pollution and improve air quality for nearby communities,"[1, 23]"
the emissions from manufacturing our products account for about 70 percent of apples gross carbon footprint we launched our supplier energy efficiency program in 2015 with the goal of helping suppliers optimize their facilities and operations to use as little energy as possible we provide guidance designed to help suppliers uncover opportunities for energy efficiency suppliers in our supplier energy efficiency program avoided more than 1150000 annualized metric tons of supply chain carbon emissions in fiscal year 2021,"[25, 17]"
this past year we intensified our efforts to reduce apples emissions in fiscal year 2021weavoidedover23 million metric tons of emissions across all scopes initiatives that we ve been growing for years like sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for our facilities transitioning suppliers to clean energy and using low carbon materials in products yielded indisputable results,[25]
thanks to this work we have begun to decouple business growth from emissions while our revenue grew33 percent our emissions grew by less than 5 percent to mitigate this increase in emissions we applied an additional 06 million tons of renewable energy credits recsand05 million metric tons of carbon offsets to proportionally cover electricity use and direct emissions respectively across our value chain this represents a short term bridging solution as we grow our carbon reduction programs to meet the scale of the challenge,"[25, 13]"
net carbon emissions represents our total gross footprint minus carbon offsets applied to each category percentages shown for each emissions category represent the share of apples gross footprint totals add up to more than 100 percent due to rounding,[25]
even a few years ago not everyone in one community in south africa had electricity at home many people had been using battery powered lanterns because up front costs and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach as we worked with our partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our power for impact program we saw exciting potential in this community,"[24, 2, 20]"
our partner on the ground dc goa solar energy provider based in johannesburg got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs ultimately dc go developed a pay as you go model that brought solar energy to 3500 homes that previously lacked access this was possible only because of the way they built relationships with community members and worked with apple top rice the solution in line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns,"[2, 17]"
in addition dc go hired and trained local people for jobs in sales maintenance and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project and the community s access to electricity would be sustainable over time,[1]
with access to electricity in their homes kids can now do homework at night and families can cook meals indoors,"[2, 20]"
our retail stores data centers and offices around the world currently source 100 percent renewable electricity we have focused our efforts to source renewables around several key pillars creating new renewable energy projects undertaking projects that deliver clear benefits to local communities and supporting renewable energy innovations about 15 gigawatts of apple created renewable electricity projects account for over 90 percent of the renewable electricity our facilities use,[24]
we continue to experience tremendous progress toward our goal of transitioning our manufacturing supply chain to100 percent renewable electricity by2030asofmarch2022213 manufacturing partners in 25 countries have committed to 100 percent renewable energy for apple production,[24]
over 70 percent of companies on apples supplier list those suppliers that make up 98 percent of apples direct spend for materials manufacturing and assembly of our products worldwide have committed to 100 percent renewable electricity in addition many other smaller suppliers have also made these commitments,"[17, 25]"
to address the non electricity emissions associated with our materials and manufacturing processes we seek technological solutions through emissions abatement or switching to low carb on fuel options for example we partnered with aluminum companies and the governments of canada and quebec to help fund research and development fore lysis a technology that eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions from aluminum smelting,[25]
many components essential to products like ours including integrated circuit chips and display panels currently rely on manufacturing processes that use fluorinated gases which have high global warming potential were partnering closely with key manufacturers to prevent these gases from being,"[13, 25]"
to address emissions from shipping products to our customers we are shifting whenever possible toward less carbon intensive shipping modes such as rail and ocean and were seeking out technical innovations including alternative fuels and electric vehicles in fiscal year 2021appleavoided180000 metric tons of co2e by shifting the mode of transport and,[25]

in the procurement and product development cycles since fiscal year 20209 percent of prospective suppliers evaluated for code related risks have been prevented from entering our supply chain for being unable or unwilling to meet our code and standards,"[17, 3, 11]"
once new suppliers are awarded apple business we begin the process of helping them quickly get up to speed on our requirements through our supplier on boarding process in 2021we expanded our on boarding process to engage new suppliers at an even earlier stage in their working relationship with apple,"[17, 3]"
we also extend our support to help prospective suppliers correct compliance issues found during the procurement process even when the supplier is not awarded apples business at no cost to the participating companies since 202068 percent of companies that were not awarded apple business elected to join this voluntary program helping to protect people and the planet beyond the reach of our business and supply chain,"[3, 17]"
we take a broad comprehensive approach to engaging with our suppliers to confirm that our standards are met one of the tools that we employ are assessments assessments also known as audits are one of several methods we use to measure compliance,[17]
with our requirements these independent third party assessments which take place on site at supplier facilities provide a snapshot of a suppliers performance however when combined with regular engagement with supplier teams mandated reporting and listening directly to hundreds of thousands of supplier employees about their workplace experiences our rigorous supplier assessments provide a clear measure of their performance in upholding our code and standards,"[0, 8, 11]"
been taken to prevent are occurrence we prohibit retaliation of any kind against supplier employees who participate in our assessments,"[5, 11, 8]"
our goal is to work together with suppliers to help them improve their management systems rather than to simply remove them from our supply chain without helping them correct the issues we have discovered in the event that a supplier is unwilling or unable to improve their operations to meet our requirements they risk removal from our supply chain since 2009 we have directed the removal of 24 manufacturing supplier facilities and 170 smelters and refiners from our supply chain for being unwilling or unable to sufficiently improve their operations to meet our requirements,"[7, 17]"
as apples business continues to grow and expand to new areas we adapt our supplier engagement model accordingly this includes continuing to expand our scope to conduct independent third party assessments of a growing number of suppliers that support our business outside of manufacturing last year we increased our engagement and expanded the application of our code and standards to suppliers supporting newer areas of apples business including those that work with our content services like apple tv and apple fitness,"[0, 17]"
these assessments also include unannounced assessments and unannounced visits in response to workers grievances and allegations or to verify risks at supplier facilities based on predictive analytics in fiscal year 2021211 unannounced assessments and investigations were conducted where the supplier facility was provided no advance notice of our arrival this is nearly double the number conducted in 2020,[1]
in addition to third party code of conduct assessments we require many of our suppliers to also undergo the responsible business alliances rba validated assessment program vap a facility wide third party assessment,"[0, 17, 12]"
widely used by the industry a total of 99rbavap assessments were completed in fiscal year 2021at apple supplier sites,[17]
if we uncover noncompliance in the course of any assessment or engagement we take prompt action so that suppliers not only correct and remedy the issue but make meaningful long term changes to their systems and processes we do this through a corrective action plan cap during which 3060and90day checkins with apple are required we then conduct our corrective action verification cav process to verify that all corrective actions have been successfully implemented and necessary steps have,[3]
people come first in everything we do our commitment to protecting the people in our supply chain has been unwavering anchored by a simple set of beliefs people deserve to be treated with dignity and to know their rights they should be able to speak up if those rights are not being respected and to know and expect that when they do we will listen and act,"[10, 17, 0]"
we are committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain just like we do for our team members customers and other partners and more broadly to working with others to share our tools and the lessons weve learned and to empowering everyone to achieve progress more rapidly,"[10, 17]"
effective grievance channels ongoing worker management communications and supplier employee feedback are essential to ensuring respect for worker rights and maintaining safe and healthy workplaces whether through social dialogue and formal employee representation workplace satisfaction surveys anonymous hotlines focus groups or interviews during annual assessments the feedback we receive directly from supplier employees helps us ensure labor and human rights are respected throughout our global supply chain we also use this feedback to address emerging risks improve rights training for supplier employees and supplier management and to continually strengthen our code and standards,"[9, 11]"
feedback channels supplier employee interviews are an important part of every assessment conducted each year we interview tens of thousands of supplier employees in their local language and without their managers present to determine whether or not their experience on the job aligns with auditors observations during assessments in fiscal year 2021 despite the ongoing challenges presented by the covid19 pandemic we interviewed 87626 workers in our supply chain over 35000 more than were interviewed in the previous fiscal year,"[1, 17]"
in2021 we launched a grievance hotline awareness campaign and its initial rollout resulted in a22 percent increase in utilization of these third party hotlines the reports we received from supplier employees via hotline sin2021 included issues related to wages and benefits employee relations amenities at supplier facilities workforce stability and health and safety in each case we investigated and worked directly with the suppliers to drive improvement and correct any compliance issues found suppliers implemented a number of actions as a result of supplier employee feedback through these,"[0, 9, 11]"
we are committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain,[10]
channels including improvements to working hours resignation processes timing of bonuses and the use of personal protective equipment ppe,[11]
also engage with supplier employees to understand their overall workplace satisfaction in 2021we anonymously surveyed 264963 supplier employees in 191 facilities across greater china india ireland malaysia philippines singapore uk you sand vietnam about their workplace experiences nearly double the number of supplier employees surveyed last fiscal year as a result suppliers to ok3944 actions including better commute options increasing wages and bonuses offering better food variety and skill development opportunities for entry level managers,[11]
our code and standards and the protections they provide apply equally to all workers regardless of a persons job geographic location or how they enter our supply chain and this commitment begins even before a worker ever enters our supply chain this includes zero tolerance for forced labor,"[0, 17, 11]"
we strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor throughout our worldwide supply chain and look for evidence of it in every supplier assessment we conduct including unannounced assessments last year we conducted more than 1100 assessments and found no instances where anyone was forced to work in our supply chain,"[11, 17]"
we did discover two cases in taiwan in which people paid recruitment fees to secure their job which is a violation of our code we required the supplier to directly repay their employees in full and verified repayment through a third party auditor the payment of recruitment fees withholding an employees passport or personal identity documents or restricting an employees freedom of movement are core violations of our code and standards the most serious level of code violations if we discover workers have paid recruitment fees at any point on their employment journey to an apple supplier we require supplier management to take prompt action to provide remedy to those affected by directly repaying their workers for any and all fees even if the supplier was unaware that their employees had paid recruitment fees from 2008 through fiscal year 2021 our suppliers have repaid332 million in recruitment fees directly to 37322 workers,"[0, 8, 11]"
finally in collaboration with the international organization for migration iom and the responsible business alliance rba we expanded our responsible labor recruitment toolkit to more than 39 additional supplier facilities in 10 countries reaching nearly 77000 workers globally with 66 percent of those working on apple production lines,"[24, 11]"
apple policies and our supplier requirements align with international labor and human rights standards including those of the international labour organization the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights un gps and the organisation for economic cooperation and development,"[10, 11]"
our human rights policy outlines how we treat everyone including our customers employees business partners and the people across every level of our supply chain,"[10, 8, 17]"
our supplier requirements contain strict standards for responsible labor recruitment and apply to all suppliers protecting workers globally we go above and beyond legal requirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor recruitment in regions where we can not conduct adequate due diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy because we believe no one should pay to secure a job,"[11, 17]"
an effective strategy requires deep understanding of our supply chain to date we have mapped over 1000 labor recruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across 32 countries,[17]
the apple responsible labor recruitment toolkit developed in partnership with the international organization for migration provides suppliers and their labor agencies with easy to use tools that help them effectively manage and report data mitigating forced labor risks before people even enter our supply chain in addition to providing hands on training we are making these tools openly available for others to use,[11]
we require our suppliers to provide their employees with training on their workplace rights on their first day on the job this helps to ensure that every person is aware of,[8]
their rights and what to do if they are not being respected which includes the ability to anonymously contact apple directly foreign contract workers who make up a very small percentage of people in our supply chain also receive training prior to leaving their home country as well as upon arriving in their destination country to date our suppliers have provided workplace rights training to over 236 million people in addition last year we directly engaged with over 350000 people in our supply chain to learn more about their workplace experience,"[11, 17, 8]"
through our new supplier employee development fund we are investing 50m to expand programs designed to continue to improve the rights training experience worker voice platforms and supplier employee education opportunities,[8]
we regularly conduct independent third party assessments including surprise assessments of our suppliers verifying compliance with over 500 points across our standards this includes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring and personnel records are in place and accurate in addition to specialized forced labor assessments for at risk suppliers we also require many suppliers to participate in facility wide assessments such as the validated assessment program to verify performance across the suppliers entire business in the event that we find gaps in a suppliers compliance or capabilities we require them to implement a corrective action plan to date our assessments have covered 94 percent of our direct manufacturing spend,"[17, 11]"
forced labor in any form is a core violation the most serious,[11]
