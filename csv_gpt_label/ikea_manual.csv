"During FY22, we continued to explore how  to create transparency in the complex  inorganics supply chains. Together with  suppliers and sub-suppliers, and other  actors in the sector, the IKEA business is  looking into how traceability of these raw  materials, up to the source of origin, could  be possible to achieve in a realistic and  trustworthy way. These collaborations have  also looked at how to identify and mitigate  risks along the supply chain",[0]

"People around the world are facing rising  prices due to inflation. The IKEA business  also struggles with inflation and, unlike in  FY21, has no longer been able to absorb  the continuous increase in costs. This has  led to necessary price increases for our  customers. With the global rise of raw  material and commodity prices, as well  as other costs for sourcing and supplying  products, securing low prices remains  a big challenge, but we continue to do  our utmost to deliver on our affordability  ambitions",[2]

"In FY22, 91 concerns related to Inter IKEA Group were  reported, an increase of 21% compared to FY21, when  75 concerns were reported. The increase can partly  be attributed to the opening of the Raise a Concern  platform externally. The majority of the concerns  were reported in the supply operations, which have  the most co-workers. Most cases reported concerned  either HR or business ethics related topics (e.g.,  harassment, discrimination, leadership behaviour,  conflict of interest and bribery). 47% of the concerns  raised were found to be (partly) substantiated,  leading to different disciplinary actions and process  improvements",[7]

"As previously reported, in FY21, we identified  negative impacts on children working in the  lower tiers of the supply chain. We’ve worked  together with The Centre for Child Rights and  Business to understand the situation and, with  a community-level approach, tackle the root  causes of the issues. We’ve also engaged other  relevant stakeholders to address child rights  issues more broadly and make them aware of  our ambitions, as well as learnings and good  practices from our project. The project will  continue to inform our broader supply chain  management",[10]
"During the IWAY audits and verification activities  performed in FY22, no suspected or confirmed  cases of child labour were identified. We are closely  monitoring this at all our suppliers.

"Comparing the performance of the IKEA climate  footprint versus the business growth is difficult  in FY22 due to high inflation and supply chain  disruptions. It’s therefore important that we  analyse the underlying performance. The decrease  in the climate footprint in FY22 can be attributed  to multiple factors, including a higher share of  renewable energy across the value chain and  improved energy efficiency of product use at home",[24]
"One of the main contributors to the decreased  climate footprint is our more energy-efficient range,  such as the new and more affordable SOLHETTA  LED range. We also saw a continued increase in the  share of sales for our plant-based food options, such  as the plant ball and the veggie hotdog",[24]
