objective is to phase out our use of Styrofoam and replace it  Wood has been a focus in this work because it is a key  component for us. In the 2023 fiscal year we developed a  comprehensive database of sourced Flexsteel products that  contain wood fiber. This database serves as a starting point  to determine the amount of sustainable wood used in our  products and will help us track our progress in the future,17
We prioritize timber and wood fiber that is legally  harvested and sourced responsibly using environmentally  and socially sustainable forestry practices,23
•  Best is FSC Certified Wood – wood that is from forests  managed in line with Forest Stewardship Council  principles and criteria,4
"•  Better is PEFC, SFI, or FSC Controlled Wood –  wood that is from forests with Programme for the  Endorsement of Forest Certification, Sustainable  Forestry Initiative certification, or wood that mixes  FSC-certified material with non-certified materials  grown and harvested under controlled conditions",8
•  Good is wood that is certified by a local or national  authority in countries with low risk of illegal logging,3
"In the 2023 fiscal year, we sourced 17,530 cubic meters of  wood through third party suppliers of sourced finished  goods. Of this, 21% was sourced from third-party certified  forestlands: 11% was classified as Best and 10% was classified  as Good. The remainder was all legally logged under the  requirements of the Lacey Act, a 2008 Farm Bill that combats  illegal trafficking of plant and timber materials",15
"In the next year, we will strive to secure similar detailed  information for wood used by our own manufacturing facilities",8
"with honeycomb cardboard, which is considerably easier to  recycle. This change not only reduces waste but also enhances  convenience for our customers while maintaining the high  quality they expect from us.  We are proud to share that we  have already successfully implemented these modifications  for one of our newest product lines, and we have plans to  introduce similar changes to further product lines",0
"Extending our commitment to sustainable materials  sourcing, we have implemented a well-established process  of annually surveying all our suppliers and internal locations  to identify and eliminate any use in our products of conflict  minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed  groups in the DRC and surrounding countries. This process  confirms that there is no indication at this time that any  of our products incorporate any conflict minerals",23
outcomes of these surveys are reported to the Securities  and Exchange Commission,15

recognize that our products will spend a significantly  longer time in our customers’ homes than they ever will  in our factories. This awareness drives us to prioritize and  uphold the highest standards throughout our entire  manufacturing process,17
"We have implemented comprehensive product, safety,  and compliance testing programs at each of our sites",9
These programs serve as the foundation for early issue  identification and help us minimize rejection rates,8
"When an issue is identified, we empower employees at  every level to raise their hands and share their concerns",12
"At Flexsteel, we prioritize chemical safety and  environmental responsibility. We believe that no product  dedication to continuous improvement",3
"should compromise any person’s safety or harm the  planet. That’s why we adhere to strict chemical safety  standards, tests, and processes",15
that all newly sourced items adhere to   these established standards,8
"For manufactured wood used in our products, we obtain  TSCA Title VI/CANFER compliance records annually,  certifying adherence to formaldehyde emissions  regulations. As we further develop our ESG initiatives, we  are committed to expanding these testing measures to  encompass our existing products. This comprehensive  approach will also include conducting regulatory retesting  every three years, with a goal to not only meet but exceed  the ambitious targets we set for ourselves",15
"In addition to upholding our own rigorous quality and  safety requirements, we are fully committed to ensuring  that all our products meet or surpass all regulations  established by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety  Commission (CPSC). We take immense pride in the fact  that we have not been involved in any product recalls  in conjunction with CPSC. This stands as a testament to  our resolute commitment to delivering products that  not only protect the well-being of our customers but  also ensure their furniture can be passed down from  generation to generation",15

The comprehensive  program includes supplier environmental management  system certifications and an additional 75 audit points  based on SA8000 and Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit  now working to close any corrective actions for those  factories audited within the past six months. The ongoing  performance of factories will be monitored with both  internal and supplier audits, and the frequency of audits  will be adjusted from 30 days to two years based on  the severity of any infractions discovered.

The SA8000 Standard is based on internationally  a positive difference",15
"recognized standards of decent work, including the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, ILO conventions, and national  laws. SMETA is widely used globally to assess standards of  labor, health and safety, environment, and business ethics",15
"With the implementation of this enhanced program,  we aim to ensure that our suppliers not only meet our  stringent requirements but also align with internationally  respected benchmarks for ethical and sustainable  practices. By prioritizing the well-being of workers,  New suppliers will need to meet the stringent  requirements of our program before they join us",15
"country leaders conduct thorough evaluations, including  comprehensive in-person meetings and detailed factory  walk-through audits, to assess the level of environmental  and social responsibility. To expedite new supplier  recruitment, we actively seek suppliers who have already  undergone successful audits conducted by reputable  auditors, enhancing our confidence in their adherence to  fostering a safe working environment, and upholding  industry best practices and standards",8
We expect the highest of standards from our suppliers  and understand our responsibility to provide the necessary  support to meet and exceed those expectations,15
In 2022 we introduced a new training program to enhance  our finished goods suppliers’ understanding of our ESG  initiatives and our audit and corrective action processes,17
"This new training serves as a valuable resource to our  suppliers and educates them on our FSC documentation  requirements, the importance of collecting renewable  consumption data, and guidelines on sharing  details about their environmental policy and waste  management systems",21
"All our existing suppliers have completed the training,  demonstrating their commitment to continuous  improvement. Moving forward, completion of this  training will be a prerequisite for any new suppliers to  ensure they are well informed and prepared to meet  our rigorous standards from the outset. Moreover, we  understand that corrective actions may be necessary  following audits. To address these areas for improvement,  we provide additional training to our suppliers on the  specific items outlined in the corrective action plans,  enabling them to take prompt and effective steps  towards rectification if necessary",10
"We firmly believe the future of our planet depends on a  collective commitment to the efficient and sustainable use  of the Earth’s precious resources. At Flexsteel, we refuse to  be bystanders, and instead, we seek to actively engage to  shape a better tomorrow. Recognizing our responsibility,  we understand the imperative of reducing water  consumption and transitioning towards renewable energy  sources, not only because it aligns with our values, but also  because it is crucial for the well-being of our planet and  the long-term success of our business",24

"Another crucial aspect to reduce transport emissions is the  optimization of product and packaging design. We strive  to decrease weight and size while introducing sustainable  materials, all while maintaining the high quality and  necessary protection during transit. This approach allows  us to achieve greater efficiency without compromising the  product integrity that our customers have come to expect  from our brands",17
"To achieve these goals, we are actively repositioning our  manufacturing sources to be in or near the U.S. to minimize  the distances our products travel, particularly via ocean  freight — a move that will reduce our exposure to the  supply chain delays and disruptions seen in recent years",25
"When sourcing our materials, we prioritize options that  travel the shortest possible distance to manufacturing  sites, ensuring the lowest possible carbon emissions while  still meeting our strict quality requirements",12
"Through these comprehensive efforts, we embrace the  responsibility to mitigate our transport emissions",8
