"This report summarises our performance compared to  the IKEA sustainability strategy, People & Planet Positive,  during FY22. It covers the entire IKEA value chain and  franchise system and provides an update on activities  and the ongoing work to measure progress. The IKEA  Sustainability Report is issued by Inter IKEA Group"
"The reporting period follows the financial year 2022  (FY22), which runs from 1 September 2021 to 31 August  2022. Percentages in this report may not total 100% due  to rounding differences"
The IKEA business is defined as the business activities  performed by all entities operating under the IKEA  Brand. “We” in this report refers to the IKEA business
"IKEA value chain includes sourcing and extracting raw  materials, manufacturing, transporting of products, retail  activities in stores, customer travel to stores, product use  in customers’ homes and product end-of-life"
"To ensure the long-term growth and development of the  IKEA business, we use a franchise system. This provides  financial stability while allowing franchisees to challenge,  test and explore new markets and ideas. Together, we  continue to develop the IKEA Brand"
1 Inter IKEA Group consists of Inter IKEA Holding B.V. and all its subsidiaries
An overview of all Inter IKEA Holding subsidiaries can be found here
"FY22 was a year of challenges affecting  people all over the world as well as  the IKEA business – the still ongoing  COVID-19 pandemic, the devastating  war in Ukraine, high inflation impacting  cost of living, climate change, escalating  nature loss and rising inequalities"
"times like these, it’s more important  than ever to stay committed to our  sustainability strategy – it’s critical for  our business and an important part of  fulfilling our vision"
"In this challenging year, we first and foremost  want to thank all our colleagues, customers and  suppliers for their continued support and hard work"
"Together, we keep the IKEA spirit alive! The war in Ukraine is a human tragedy that  continues to affect people and communities"
priority has been to provide support and security  to co-workers and the people in our value chain
"In the beginning of March 2022, Inter IKEA Group  and Ingka Group announced the pausing of IKEA  operations in Russia and Belarus. In June, the  decision was taken to stop IKEA operations in those  countries and we've since been scaling down, step  by step"
"Despite the complex situation, total IKEA sales  reached EUR 44.6 billion in FY22, up 6.5% compared  to FY21. The pandemic limited growth in FY21, and  IKEA retail sales benefited as the world re-opened"
"On the other hand, higher costs for raw materials  and transport led to higher prices, which means  sales grew in monetary terms, but not in quantities"
"and production. Twenty-four IKEA retail markets  are using 100% renewable electricity. In production,  it increased from 52% in FY21 to 64%. One of our  key strengths is the IKEA integrated supply chain"
We have long-term relationships with our suppliers  – 11 years on average – and are supporting their  journeys to transition to renewable energy
"With a carbon budget of six years left in the world,1  the need to act decisively to limit global warming to  1.5°C is more important than ever. We’re committed  to doing our part, taking a full value chain approach"
"The total IKEA climate footprint in FY22 is estimated  to be 25.8 million tonnes of CO2 eq – a decrease of  5% compared to FY21 and 12% compared to our FY16  baseline. The reduced climate footprint is mainly  due to a strong development in renewable electricity  and improved efficiency of products used at home,  and partly due to slightly lower production volumes  between FY21-22"
"One of the main contributors to the decreased  climate footprint is our more energy-efficient range,  such as the new and more affordable SOLHETTA  LED range. We also saw a continued increase in the  share of sales for our plant-based food options, such  as the plant ball and the veggie hotdog"
"During FY22, we also managed to increase the  share of renewable electricity in both IKEA retail  Our focus ahead remains on the longer-term  agenda, such as product transport and materials  – our largest climate footprint. For materials,  we have concrete plans to reduce our impact"
challenge for materials is to secure the accuracy  and completeness of the data. See the IKEA Climate  Report FY22 for more details
"Establishing a systemic shift to a circular economy,  not only within the IKEA business but throughout  the world, is key to creating a sustainable future,  since the high use of resources in the world is  increasing the pressure on people and the planet"
"Now, several years into our efforts to transform into  a circular business, we have a clearer and practical  understanding of the complexities. After some years  of testing in various markets, we formally created  the global IKEA Core Circular Customer Offer which  will make it possible for customers to pass on,  refurbish, care for, maintain and upgrade products  in convenient ways"
"1 Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, ""Remaining carbon budget"", 1.5°C scenario selected, 2022 2 The volume of products manufactured in FY22 was 10% higher than in the baseline year FY16, but 1% lower than FY21"
3 A just transition addresses the social consequences of actions taken to reduce climate impact and transition to a circular economy
"We strive to take a holistic approach to our  sustainability work, as climate change, nature loss  and inequality are interdependent. The transition  to a circular economy with limited environmental  impact creates additional challenges for livelihoods  and human rights. Therefore, we put a lot of effort  during the year into revising the Fair & equal section  of the IKEA sustainability strategy. The update  includes strengthened commitments to contribute  to more resilient societies, with a continued focus  on children as a particularly vulnerable group"
"includes new commitments, such as ensuring a just  transition3 with a focus on enabling decent work,  which involves, for example, upskilling and reskilling  to meet future demands. This update was supported  by a social impact materiality assessment"
"Our work toward becoming people and planet  positive continues, and we stay optimistic"
"long-term commitment is to make sure sustainable  living is affordable and accessible to the many, and  together we will make it happen"
"products in the IKEA range 2,000 new products launched in FY22 4"

"5  IWAY is the IKEA way of responsibly procuring products, services, materials and components. It sets requirements on environmental, social and working conditions, as well as animal welfare for all IKEA suppliers and service providers (read more)"
"The purpose of our sustainability  strategy, People & Planet Positive,  is to inspire, activate and lead us  in our decision-making and goal- setting, in order to achieve the big  positive changes we want to see in  the world, and for the entire IKEA  ecosystem"
"The strategy is structured based on material  topics (see diagram, left). These are  considered the most important sustainability  issues on which the IKEA business can have  an impact. When we developed the strategy,  we looked at what stakeholders expect from  us and where they could see us making the  biggest positive changes. As an outcome,  we clustered the identified material topics  into three major challenges: unsustainable  consumption, climate change, and inequality"
"In FY22, we carried out a materiality  assessment in connection with the revision  of the Fair & equal focus area of the strategy,  which led to the creation of new and  strengthened commitments (page 41)"
The IKEA People & Planet Positive strategy  describes the sustainability agenda and  ambition for everyone in the IKEA franchise  system and value chain. Each company  working under the IKEA Brand sets its  own strategic goals to contribute to the  common ambitions and commitments
for 2030 are in line with the UN Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs)
"We don’t have all the answers and can't  achieve our goals alone. We want to have a  positive impact on people, society and the planet. We're working – in line with  stakeholder expectations and regulations – to secure both economic growth and positive  social impact with environmental protection  and regeneration"
Our sustainability strategy is reviewed annually  to secure alignment with the total IKEA strategic  landscape and external developments
"includes assessing the changing realities  within our three key challenges: unsustainable  consumption, climate change, and inequality"
"To stay up-to-date on the ever-changing realities  of our world, we receive ongoing input from  stakeholders, key scientific reports, advisory  boards, sustainability council meetings,  partnerships, and IKEA teams. This lets us  identify and address trends within our major  challenges, revise our plans, and raise ambition  levels wherever possible"
"Inequality is rising and vulnerable  groups are increasingly impacted The continuing effects of the COVID-19  pandemic, the war in Ukraine, conflicts  in many parts of the world, and the  accelerating effects of climate change are  all adding to global instability, insecurity  and economic inflation. These effects  impact people from vulnerable groups the  hardest and lead to increasing levels of  inequality"
"In FY22, the IKEA business strengthened its  commitments to respecting human rights,  including children’s rights, throughout our  7 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 value chain. We continue to take action to  support vulnerable groups, tackle inequality,  and develop our human rights due diligence  approach to address our potential negative  impacts, as well as strive to achieve a  positive social impact (page 42)"
Urgent action is needed to limit global  warming to 1
"As reiterated at the 2022 United Nations  Climate Change Conference (COP27) in  Egypt, the international community is failing  to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement"
The world is set to inevitably reach a global  temperature increase of at least 1.5°C during  the 2030s
"The importance of drastic emission  reductions – halving emissions in absolute  terms by 2030 – to limit global warming to  1.5°C is our best opportunity to mitigate the  effects of climate change. The IKEA business  remains committed to the Paris Agreement  and to contribute by leading with facts and  science-based goals (page 20). A global  study conducted in 20223 also found the  proportion of consumers reporting that  climate change has “greatly” personally  impacted them is growing. As a global  brand, the IKEA business is part of both the  problem and the solution"
"People around the world are facing rising  prices due to inflation. The IKEA business  also struggles with inflation and, unlike in  FY21, has no longer been able to absorb  the continuous increase in costs. This has  led to necessary price increases for our  customers. With the global rise of raw  material and commodity prices, as well  as other costs for sourcing and supplying  products, securing low prices remains  a big challenge, but we continue to do  our utmost to deliver on our affordability  ambitions"
"Companies, including the IKEA business,  are now facing an increasing number of  regulations and the complexity of future   requirements. We recognise the importance  of having consistent, comparable and  transparent non-financial information and  welcome these regulatory developments"
We've started to prepare for the  reporting requirements of the Corporate  Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  and will continue the work in FY23
"Global biodiversity is declining faster than  at any other time in human history,⁴ and  this is caused by human activity, including  land use, pollution, and climate change"
"We welcome the global agreement for  biodiversity that was decided at COP15  in Montréal, Canada, as it's a critical  component of driving more action to  reverse biodiversity loss in this decade"
"Framework has the potential to enable  and mobilise all actors of society to  contribute, similar to what the Paris  Agreement has meant for limiting climate  change"
"initiative, we supported a push for  accelerated action and a levelled playing  field for global businesses, a push that  made it into the final agreement"
is to inspire and enable  more than 1 billion people  to live a better everyday  life within the boundaries  of the planet
"We will develop and promote products, services and home furnishing  solutions that inspire and enable people to reduce their impact on  the environment and/or improve their health. We will raise awareness  and share knowledge on how to live a healthier, more sustainable life  at home. Our focus is on energy, air, water, waste, and food"
"We will offer products and solutions designed from the beginning to  have circular capabilities, low environmental impact, and be made of  renewable and/or recycled materials. We will promote healthier, more  sustainable behaviours such as preventing and reducing food-related  waste, eating more plant-based and nutritious food, and acquiring,  caring for and passing on products in circular ways"
Creating a movement in society around better everyday living  We will work to make healthy and sustainable living the norm by  inspiring and enabling more sustainable behaviours in society
"includes, for example, how we use marketing and communication  to shape demand. By advocating for policies and regulations that  support a healthier, more sustainable society, we strive to use our  influence for the benefit of the many"
The circular services we offer are also  important contributors to a more  sustainable life at home. Read more about  our FY22 progress with circular customer  services on page 17
"As a large provider of food, the IKEA  business also has a responsibility to inspire  and enable healthier and more sustainable  food choices. During the year, we continued  the work of expanding and improving  our plant-based food offer by introducing  new products and strengthening our  communication approach (page 13)"
"a result, we saw an increase in the share  of sales of plant-based foods in IKEA  restaurants and Swedish Food Markets in  FY22. And we also reached our food waste  reduction goal in FY22 (page 17)"
"During the year, there were more  than 5.1 billion visits to IKEA  retail through our stores and  websites. We know we have a big  opportunity and responsibility  to make a positive difference  through our home furnishing  offer, and by sharing our home  furnishing knowledge"
"Our work to inspire and enable healthy  and sustainable living is focused on five  areas where the IKEA offer has a direct  impact on people’s health and ability to  reduce their environmental footprint at  home: energy, air, water, food, and waste"
"In FY22, in almost all of the five focus areas,  we broadened our offer of products and  services"
"In FY22, IKEA stores in many markets  opened the Sustainable Living Shop, a  space that highlights products, solutions,  services and tips for ways customers can  reduce their climate footprint in everyday  life at home"
We continue our work to enable people to be more energy efficient at home
"Growing our energy-efficient bulbs offer We expanded the functions and styles available in  our SOLHETTA LED bulb series. Launched in FY22,  SOLHETTA LED bulbs are more energy efficient  and – on average – more affordable than previous  IKEA LED bulbs.1 Expanding the series with more  sizes, shapes and functions, enables customers to  use SOLHETTA LED bulbs for more purposes and  in more areas of the home, which reduces home  energy use"
"In FY22, we sold 61.8 million LED bulbs, with  SOLHETTA making up the biggest share of sales  (in terms of sold quantity). Because SOLHETTA  is more energy efficient than previous IKEA LED  bulbs, it helped to improve the average efficiency  of our lighting range by 19% (lumen per Watt)  which contributes to a reduction of the electricity  consumption in homes. Going forward, we'll  continue to explore ways to make our LED range  more energy efficient"
"10 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 Expanding the solar panel service In FY22, the IKEA business2 partnered with  a leading solar technology and energy  services provider to extend the solar panel  offer to customers in California, USA"
"was launched to customers in September  2022. The plan is to extend to other locations  in the USA over time. The home solar service  includes solar panels and, when suitable,  a battery storage system. By turning their  rooftops into mini power plants, customers  can produce their own electricity and, if  circumstances allow, sell it back to the grid"
"In FY22, a heat pump service launched in  Sweden.2 This service enables customers to  buy quality heat pumps at more affordable  prices. It can also help customers use less  energy and save costs, based on which  heating or cooling solution the customer  had before"
"1  Specifically, when compared to LEDARE and RYET, which made up 80% of IKEA LED bulb sales before SOLHETTA launched"

Developing affordable and high performing  solutions to enable people to purify the air in  their homes is an example of how the IKEA  business can make a positive difference and  contribute to cleaner indoor air
Read more about how we’re working to  create cleaner air
"In FY22, we made air purifiers for the  home more accessible by introducing  the low-price solution UPPÅTVIND"
"all IKEA air purifiers, UPPÅTVIND is  optimised to filter out approximately  99.5% of smaller airborne particles,  including PM2.5, dust, and pollen"
"We continue our work to develop and promote  products, services and home furnishing  solutions that inspire and enable people to  handle and minimise waste at home"
"For more about how we’re working to enable  and inspire people to take part in a circular  economy, see page 17"
STARKVIND table with air purifier launched in FY22
1 PM2.5 are small inhalable particles that measure 2.5 micrometres or smaller
"In FY22, we launched the ÅBACKEN  water nozzle in all IKEA markets"
"used in mist mode, ÅBACKEN can save  up to 95% of water used, and in spray  mode, up to 66%.1 This also results in  energy savings from water heating"
ÅBÄCKEN water nozzle fits all IKEA  taps and most other taps on the  market. This solution builds on the  water saving abilities of the existing  IKEA tap and shower range which has  built-in water efficiency features that  already enable water use reduction of  up to 40%
"By continuing to develop and improve the  efficiency of our water-using products,  we’re enabling customers to decrease their  consumption. The water that runs through  the taps and showers we sell makes up  15% of the IKEA total water footprint"
Read more about saving water at home
"For information about water in our supply  chain, see page 38"
The IKEA business is a founding member  of the 50L Home Coalition – a global  action-oriented initiative focusing on  developing and scaling innovations in  water and energy use in the home
ambition is to make 50 litres of daily  water use per person a new reality
"In August 2022, Inter IKEA Group made a  minority equity investment in Flow Loop,  a Danish company that's been developing  a water recycling shower solution in  partnership with the IKEA business since  2020. The investment will help accelerate  the joint product development. The solution  recycles and cleans shower water in a closed  loop. The aim is to save up to 80% of water  use, and 70% of energy use, when compared  to average shower solutions"

"Last year, around 520 million guests  experienced the IKEA food offer in our stores"
"Throughout FY22, we continued our work to  improve and expand our plant-based food offer"
We also continued the work to make our whole  food range healthier
The climate footprint of plant-based food is  often lower compared to animal-based options
A plant-based diet with high nutritional value  can also be a healthier choice
"For information about food in our supply chain,  see page 33"
"Evaluating and revising food goals  In FY22, we initiated a re-evaluation of the  food goals that were launched in FY21"
"main reason for the revision was the need  for full transparency of the food offer in all  markets including the locally-sourced food  range, which is a substantial part of the  overall food range. Updates to our digital  reporting landscape will give us a more  complete overview of the range offer and  support us in a more holistic way to set  and measure our sustainability goals"
continue to work toward the goal that 50%  of main meals offered in our restaurants  will be plant-based by 2025
The positive trend of customers choosing plant- based food continues. The share of sales of the  plant ball and veggie ball in IKEA restaurants  increased from 14% in FY21 to 17% within the  HUVUDROLL range and from 24% in FY21 to  26% in the Swedish Food Market
"We introduced new plant-based products  in FY22, including a veggie ball version of  LÄTTLAGAT ready meals. We also launched a  plant-based soft ice with chocolate flavour"
continue to explore where and how we can  remove or replace dairy in our range (without  compromising on taste) to further reduce the  climate impact of our food ingredients
"In FY22, we tested a new communication  approach for plant-based foods in three  stores operated by IKEA Germany"
"approach was based on scientific insights  from the World Resources Institute (WRI)  for how to make plant-based foods more  appealing. Even though we didn't see an  immediate increase in sales quantity of  plant-based foods during the test period,  we received a positive response in surveys  conducted on the communication initiative  and can see a measurable improvement  in customer awareness of our plant-based  range offer. The communication approach  will therefore be rolled out in more  markets"
A positive sign is that the sales quantity of  our veggie hot dog almost doubled in FY22  compared to FY19 (before COVID-19)
can largely be attributed to a substantial  price decrease in our German market
"However, store closures in the previous  fiscal year make it difficult to compare and  draw any definite conclusions"
"In FY22, we continued the work to re- evaluate the entire IKEA food offer  according to the IKEA Food Nutrition  Profiling System (IFNPS). IFNPS classifies  foods or beverages as healthier if they have  a better nutritional composition compared  to equivalent foods from a similar product  category.2 By evaluating all our foods this  way, we can better work towards, and  measure, making our food healthier"
"During FY22, we've been working with  partners to develop the communication  approach for shifting our range to healthier  eating and to inspire more customers to  choose healthier options"
"In FY22, we launched an IKEA Food  innovation accelerator programme with  the aim of finding and developing healthier  and more sustainable raw ingredients  that can be used in our range"
"evaluating 116 companies, we're currently  working with two from the programme,  incorporating their innovations into our  product design process"
"LÄTTLAGAT is a convenient, nutritious and tasty frozen meal  featuring different IKEA balls, including the plant ball, meatball,  and now, veggie ball"
1  IKEA Germany is operated by the franchisee Ingka Group
"2  There are three levels of classification in the system: “Green” is the best, followed by “Yellow” and “Red”. “Healthier” means products have been  classified as better than ""Red"" i.e., “Green” or “Yellow”"
Our ambition is to be a  circular business by 2030
We are committed to design  all of our products with  circular capabilities
to use only renewable or  recycled materials and to  provide new solutions for  our customers to prolong  the life of products and  materials
"•  Designing every product from the very beginning to be  reused, refurbished, remanufactured and eventually – after all  other possibilities have been explored – recycled, by applying  our circular product design principles during the product  development process"
•  Aiming to only use renewable or recycled materials by adapting  and finding new sources and developing new materials
"•  Finding circular solutions for existing and new customers to  acquire, care for, and pass on products"
"•  Taking the lead and joining forces with others through  advocacy, collaboration, and business partnerships"
15 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 will increase the efficiency and accuracy of  our reporting and are therefore not able to  update these figures for FY22. We plan to  report figures for FY23
"Finally, we continued to engage with  policymakers and other partners to  advocate for a circular economy, including  the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF),  the European Commission (page 18),  and the European Furniture Industry  Confederation (EFIC) (page 18)"
"During the year, we continued  to use our circular product  development roadmaps to secure  all our products will have circular  capabilities by 2030"
"In FY22, we improved the circular  capabilities of several products, including  our soft toy range (page 37), RÖNNINGE  extendable tables (page 16) and our  best-selling BILLY bookcase (page 16)"
"improve the accuracy of measuring the  circular capabilities of our products, we're  updating the Key Performance Indicator  (KPI), which tracks the corresponding  commitment. Because of this ongoing  work, we don’t have comparative figures  for the circular fulfilment rate of our  products to report against last year’s  performance"
"After years of testing and running different  circular customer offers in various IKEA  markets (such as buy-back programmes,  selling second-hand products, and  providing spare parts), we have defined  key development areas for the IKEA Core  Circular Customer Offer. These include  furniture spare parts, circular services,  digital/physical second-hand touchpoints,  etc. We're working on the details to ensure  the offer meets customer needs"
showed the importance of making  furniture spare parts more available  to customers. It also proved that the  circular offer can be both convenient for  customers and profitable for the business  at the same time
"In FY22, we also continued working  towards our aim of only using recycled  and renewable materials (page 36)"
initiative to produce mattresses from  recycled foam (page 17) is one of several  innovative programmes in progress
"For us, products are material banks for the  future – once they can no longer be used,  they should become secondary raw materials  for new products through recycling"
why we’re working to design products to last  as long as possible and keep the value of  their materials beyond their lifespan
"Since it was launched in 1978, more than 120 million BILLY bookcases  have been sold. Today, BILLY is still one of the best-selling IKEA products"
"16 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 BILLY gets a circularity boost  In FY22, one of our best-selling products,  BILLY bookcase, was redesigned to  improve its circular capabilities"
design reduces the use of plastic and  shifts from veneer to paper foil
"materials used to produce the new BILLY  bookcase will come from renewable  sources. The new design also has snap  fittings on the back panel instead of  nails, which makes it easier to repair and  possible to disassemble and reassemble,  so it's easier for customers to bring BILLY  with them as their life and needs change"
"for all IKEA products by 2030 Throughout the year, we continued to  develop and improve our products to  have circular capabilities. An example of  improvement is RÖNNINGE extendable  table. Without compromising on the original  function, durability, style or quality, we  reduced material use by introducing hollow  wooden legs. This is also part of our ambition  to use wood in smarter ways (page 28)"
"also developed GRÖNSTA chair, improving  the circular capabilities this type of chair  usually has. Typically, this type of chair  would contain glass fibre for added stability"
"However, since glass fibre isn't recyclable, we  developed GRÖNSTA without glass fibre – its  stability comes from the seat’s form instead"
"And, in addition to being designed for  recyclability, the seat shell is made of post- industrial waste. GRÖNSTA launches in FY23"
Foam mattresses normally end up in landfills
"In FY22, we led an initiative that makes new  mattresses from discarded ones by recycling  polyols found in the foam. This initiative  decreases waste to landfills while also  contributing to driving the industry agenda  to develop foam solutions centred around  recycled materials. This initiative is ongoing  and builds on previous work to develop  and implement renewable foam in the IKEA  range. Our aim is to have a minimum of 20%  recycled and/or renewable content in the  polyols used in foam production for IKEA  mattresses by 2025. Read more"
"Achieving our food waste reduction goal  On average, we achieved the goal of  reducing food waste from preparing meals  for IKEA restaurants1 by 50% by end of  2022 compared to FY17 baseline. This was  calculated for all IKEA restaurants which  used the food waste digital solutions by  end of 2022. By the end of 2022, 91% of all  IKEA stores had food waste solutions in  place (2021: 89%)"
"The new VALEVÅG mattress contains 50% less foam than its  predecessor, HÖVÅG, while maintaining the same level of  comfort. It contains 13% renewable foam, steel springs with  25% recycled material, and both its cover and wadding are  made from recycled polyester"

Enabling and inspiring people to  take part in a circular economy Offering solutions that make products last  longer fulfils many customer wishes and  solves frustrations
"To progress towards our circular  transformation, it’s essential to engage  with our customers in new ways and enable  them to make circularity a part of their daily  lives. Over the years, we’ve conducted and  reported on numerous circular customer  service offers in various markets. In FY22,  using insights and learnings from these  experiences, we took the step of formally  creating the IKEA Core Circular Customer  Offer. We’re developing ways to make  it possible for customers to pass on,  refurbish, care for, maintain and upgrade  products in ways that are convenient for  them, available when they need them,  and close to their homes. This will help  customers extend the lifespans of their  products and maintain the value of the  materials in their products for longer"
We’ve defined the key development areas of  the offer and are currently creating and testing  initiatives within them
"Prolonging the lifespans of sofas through  repair and refurbishment in Poland Sofas experience a lot of everyday use,  making them susceptible to wear and tear  over time. In FY22, we continued to test  sofa repair and refurbishment services in  IKEA Poland.1 We gained experience and an  understanding of the challenges and costs  connected to reverse logistics, refurbishing  competence, and resale of refurbished  sofas. The test also confirmed sufficient  customer demand to prolong the lifespan  of IKEA sofas through sales of repaired/ refurbished sofas, repair services, and a do- it-yourself furniture spare parts offer"
"to overcome, such as securing the  knowledge of which furniture spare parts  are most needed, the amount of skilled  labour and level of expertise required for  refurbishment, and the cost of logistics"
We’re now making more furniture spare  parts for sofas available to customers and  are further testing repair at the IKEA store  and third-party locations

2 The number reported in FY21 was for both assembly parts and furniture  spare parts. We’ve now separated these two types of parts to be more  accurate and transparent in our reporting. Though furniture spare  parts have been a small percentage of the reported figure in the past  (around 1%) we’re working to increase the amount of furniture spare  parts delivered to customers

"18 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 Growing our spare parts offer Customers can order assembly parts (such  as nuts, bolts and screws that are shown in  assembly instructions) through an online  tool. In FY22, we provided more than 21"
million assembly parts to enable customers  to prolong the lifespan of IKEA products  (FY21: 18 million)
"We’re developing solutions to provide  furniture spare parts, such as back and seat  cushions. This includes solutions that are  globally scalable, offering a convenient way  to order while keeping furniture spare parts  affordable for customers"
"In FY22, IKEA Singapore3 partnered with Carousell, an online  marketplace for second-hand selling, to inspire and empower  consumers to take part in the circular economy. Local celebrities  got involved to help create conversations around circularity and  customers who bought or sold IKEA furniture on the platform  received rewards"
Our commitment to sharing knowledge and  working together with others to advance the  transformation toward the circular economy  continues through our advocacy efforts
"While we continue to learn more about  our own business capabilities within these  areas, we also engage in open dialogue with  policymakers and other partners"
"As the European Green Deal (EU Green Deal)  sets out various legislative and non-legislative  proposals, we continue to actively share our  experience with policymakers on how we're  transforming into a circular and climate  positive business. During FY22, we remained  active in providing fact- and experience-based  insights and contributions to the ongoing  work of the EU Green Deal, which includes the  Circular Economy Action Plan. Key topics we  contributed to included the development of  the digital product passport, eco-design for  sustainable product regulation, and the right to  repair. Read more"
"Together with the EFIC and EuroCommerce, we  supported enabling measures for sustainable  business growth within the furniture industry  as well as the harmonisation of rules, and  alignment of definitions"
We also contributed to the 2022 Circular  Economy Stakeholder Conference and EFIC’s  “The Furniture Day 2022” by sharing our  insights about developing circular capabilities  within the furniture industry
"By FY30, IKEA is committed to  becoming climate positive by  reducing more greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions than the  IKEA value chain emits, while  growing the IKEA business"
This will be achieved without  relying on carbon offsetting

by the end of the century
"gas emissions from the IKEA  value chain in absolute terms  in line with the 1.5°C target,1  while contributing to additional  reductions in society"
"Read more about our work on  climate change, including a detailed  breakdown of our climate footprint"
"The overall goal is, by FY30, to reduce the absolute  GHG emissions from the IKEA value chain by at least  15% compared to FY16, while still growing the IKEA  business. In addition, sub-goals are set for specific  parts of the IKEA value chain. Together, these sub- goals add up to a larger reduction than the 15% in the  overall goal"
"Trees and agricultural crops – which are used for  materials, food and fuels – absorb and store carbon  as they grow, in the plant itself and in the soil"
"removes CO2 from the atmosphere and, if the land  is responsibly managed, has a potential to reduce  climate impact. In contrast to carbon offsets, this  takes place within our supply chain and is part of how  we responsibly source materials for the IKEA range"
"A strategic goal will be set once the Land Sector and  Removals Guidance by GHG Protocol is finalised,  which is expected to be in the spring of 2023"
"accounting guidance is the final piece since the  Forestry, Agriculture and Land (FLAG) target setting  standard by Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) was  launched in September 2022. Even though a goal has  not yet been set, we're taking actions that we know  will have a positive contribution"
"To reduce more GHG emissions than we emit,  we will contribute to additional reductions in  society by taking an extended responsibility for  the climate footprint of our customers, suppliers  and in our sourcing areas and not just the part  which we can account for as part of the IKEA  climate footprint. A strategic goal will be set  once the guidance is ready for “removing and  storing carbon” and when the framework for  going beyond has been developed by SBTi"
"We are taking actions that we know will have a  positive contribution, even though a goal has  yet to be set"
"We'll achieve our climate positive ambition  without using carbon offsets, as we firmly  believe that we need to address the root  causes of our climate footprint within our own  value chain or in connection to our customers,  suppliers, and sourcing areas. Only by doing so  can we transform into a sustainable business"

Goal FY30 compared to baseline (FY16) FY16: 29
Goal FY30 compared to FY16 FY22: 25
"The largest portion of the IKEA climate footprint comes from raw  material extraction and processing (52.2%) and IKEA product use in  customers’ homes (13.7%), which includes the energy consumption  of lighting and appliances over the lifetime of a product"
"For a full breakdown of the climate footprint accounting, scope 1, 2  and 3 emissions, read the IKEA Climate Report FY22"
"In FY22, the total IKEA climate footprint decreased by 1.4 million  tonnes of CO2 eq in absolute terms compared to the previous  year – a reduction of 5%. The reduction was driven by continued  strong progress in the use of renewable energy across the  value chain and significantly improving the energy efficiency for  product use at home"
"1 Historical data should not change, but we always revise historical figures if data quality or  science has improved"
"2 Includes the climate footprints of capital goods, materials connected to retail equipment and  co-worker clothing, and waste generated in IKEA operations"
"In FY22, the IKEA climate footprint is estimated to  be 25.8 million tonnes CO2 eq, a decrease of 5%  compared to FY21 and 12% compared to baseline  year FY16. When looking at how the relative  climate footprint in terms of volume produced has  developed compared to FY21, it has decreased by  4% tonnes CO2 eq per produced volume (m3) of IKEA  products. Compared to baseline FY16, the relative  reduction has been 20%"
"Comparing the performance of the IKEA climate  footprint versus the business growth is difficult  in FY22 due to high inflation and supply chain  disruptions. It’s therefore important that we  analyse the underlying performance. The decrease  in the climate footprint in FY22 can be attributed  to multiple factors, including a higher share of  renewable energy across the value chain and  improved energy efficiency of product use at home"
The decrease is also a result of lower volumes  produced
"The share of renewable energy for IKEA retail and  other operations increased from 57% in FY21 to  64% in FY22, with renewable electricity reaching a  share of 76%. In production, the renewable energy  share increased from 46% in FY21 to 50% in FY22,  while renewable electricity increased to 64%"
"22 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 and hydrogen, remained flat at 6%, while the GHG  efficiency (in terms of kg CO2 eq per tonnes and  kilometres transported) improved by 11% compared  to FY21"
"Product use at home is the second largest part  of the climate footprint, and in FY22 we saw a  reduction of 20% compared to FY21. Since the  baseline year FY16, the product use at home  footprint has decreased by 45%. Additionally, we  saw a slight increase in the share of sales in IKEA  restaurants for plant-based options, increasing from  14% in FY21 to 17% in FY22, within the HUVUDROLL  range"
For the materials used in IKEA products – the  largest climate footprint – material innovation and  development plans are set and are expected to  lead to new and more efficient use of materials
"still difficult to draw any conclusions about the full  performance since the amount of materials used  in the IKEA range is based on estimations for most  types of materials, including the share of recycled or  renewable materials"
"In FY23, our digital development will reach  important milestones, allowing us to better analyse  performance through more accurate measurements  of the climate footprints of materials"
expected to be in place for the IKEA Sustainability  Report FY23 and IKEA Climate Report FY23
"1 Due to high inflation and supply chain disruptions in FY22, the climate footprint is compared against the produced volume of IKEA products, as opposed to retail  sales in the FY21 report. Produced volume was determined to be a more relevant and consistent basis for comparison since it is the main driver of the largest  portion of the climate footprint - materials"
Increasing the share of plant-based food sold  The positive trend of customers choosing plant- based food continues. The share of sales of the  plant ball and veggie ball in IKEA restaurants  increased from 14% in FY21 to 17% within the  HUVUDROLL range and from 24% in FY21 to  26% in the Swedish Food Market
"The launch of the new LED range SOLHETTA  in October 2021 was a success, contributing  to improving the overall efficiency (in terms  of lumen per Watt) of our lighting range by  19% and a key contributor to reducing the  footprint of product use at home by 20%  compared to FY21"
"Increasing share of renewable electricity  for production in Poland and China The renewable electricity share for  production in China increased from 32% in  FY21 to 64%, while in Poland it increased  from 76% in FY21 to 84%. This resulted in the  climate footprint of electricity consumption  in China and Poland decreasing by 0"
"million tonnes CO2 eq. The development in  China was supported by the programme to  enable the purchase of renewable electricity  for suppliers, launched in FY21"
"23 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 Towards the phase-out of coal- and  fossil oil-based fuels in production  An additional 12 suppliers have phased  out the use of coal on-site. Overall, a  reduction of one percentage point was  achieved. Since FY16, we have reduced  the use of coal- and fossil oil-based fuels  in production from 12% to 5%, with the  aim to reach zero by FY25"
"The IKEA business has committed to reach  zero-emissions solutions for all product  transports and home deliveries1 by calendar  year 2040 at the latest, through initiatives  EV100, EV100+ and Cargo Owners for Zero  Emission Vessels (coZEV). Not only will this  reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but  also air pollution"
The efficiency of product transports  improved by 11% compared to FY21
improvement was driven by an increased  share of ocean transportation and the  high share (46%) of land intermodal3  transportation
The renewable electricity share for IKEA  retail and other operations increased  to 76% compared to 71% in FY21
"achieved 100% renewable electricity in  Austria and Spain (mainland), and made  significant progress in some markets,  especially China (from 8% in FY21 to 98%  in FY22)"
"Reaching our food waste reduction goal The IKEA business reached the goal of  reducing food waste from preparing  meals in IKEA restaurants4 globally by 50%  by the end of 2022 (54%), compared to  FY17. By the end of 2022, 91% of all IKEA  stores had food waste solutions in place  (2021: 89%)"
2 Transport efficiency is measured in relative terms as kilogram  CO2 eq emitted per transported tonne and kilometre
"3 Land intermodal transport refers to multiple modes of transport,  such as rail, barge or short sea used in combination with trucks"
"4 Specifically, food preparation in the IKEA restaurant, bistro,  Swedish café and co-worker restaurant"
"Air pollutants and GHG emissions often come  from the same source and there is a strong  synergy between the actions needed to reduce  emissions. What has been missing for companies  is a scientifically robust method that provides the  appropriate approaches to quantify air pollutant  emissions across their value chain. To address  this, Inter IKEA Group, together with Stockholm  Environment Institute (SEI) and the Climate & Clean  Air Coalition (CCAC), developed the first-ever guide  for businesses on measuring outdoor air pollution  across value chains"
"The guide, “A Practical Guide for Business: Air  Pollutant Emission Assessment” was launched  for all companies at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh,  Egypt, after a year's pilot trial. This year, in the IKEA  Climate Report FY22, we are publishing one of the  first-ever air pollutant emissions inventories of a  business across a value chain. Having a baseline  will enable us to manage our impact on air  pollution and set goals for reductions in the future"
"During FY22, we continued to contribute to the  work of the GHG Protocol in developing their Land  Sector and Removals Guidance. This will extend the  GHG Protocol with guidance on how to account for  and report GHG emissions and carbon removals  and storage connected to land use. The IKEA  business has been part of the Advisory Committee  and Technical Working Groups and has been  conducting pilots during the public consultation in  the fall of 2022"
"The guidance provides the accounting principles  for the target setting standard by Science Based  Targets initiative (SBTi) on land-based emissions  and removals from Forest, Land and Agriculture  (FLAG) – work that the IKEA business also  contributed to"
"The completion of the guidance is expected during  the spring of 2023. Once it's ready, we'll set a  strategic goal for removing and storing carbon  through forestry, agriculture and products as part  of our climate positive commitment. Although  the effect of removing and storing carbon will  potentially be significant, it's important to recognise  that carbon removals and storage can never replace  the drastic emission reductions needed to limit  global warming to 1.5°C. Removals and storage can  only neutralise any remaining emissions after they  have been reduced as far as possible"
"As pilots are currently ongoing and the standard  will soon be finalised, we have decided not to  disclose any performance this year"
"24 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 Forest plantations grow faster  than the natural forests, as  described below, and can  remove carbon from the  atmosphere at a higher pace"
"When logged, CO2 remains stored in products  made from wood (An estimated lifetime of 20  years has been used for wood-based products  and excludes the effects of recycling"
"By recycling the wood at the end of a product's  life, the removed carbon continues to be stored"
"By prolonging the life of wood-based products,  the removed carbon remains stored even longer"
Natural forests play a crucial role for climate change mitigation
"example they grow slower than the plantation, and reach an even state  of carbon removed and stored. At the same time, these areas are of great  importance due to their already stored carbon and biodiversity. They need to  be an integral part of any landscape approach to secure healthy ecosystems"
"A simplified model of removing and storing carbon through the establishment of fast growing tree plantations plus  restoration of natural forests on degraded land, including the effect of prolonging the carbon storage effect through  wood based products and recycling. Trees from responsibly managed forest plantations absorb substantial amounts of carbon  dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. When trees are made into wood-based products, they act as temporary carbon storage"
"storage effect can be extended through reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling of the material at end-of-life"
"resilient landscapes, the contribution of responsibly managed forest plantations towards climate change mitigation, and the  many contributions of natural forests, in terms of biodiversity or soil protection, for example, have to be considered together"
"A forest's landscape resilience is important in itself in order to secure that the carbon is not released back to the atmosphere  due to extraordinary weather events or pests (for instance). A holistic view, where we balance forest growth, carbon storage and  other environmental services, such as biodiversity, is critical"
"Piloting the coming Land Sector and  Removals Guidance by GHG Protocol We're actively engaging in the development  of the Land Sector and Removals Guidance by  GHG Protocol. The current focus is on pilots  where the draft guidance is tested in practice  in order to discover how it incentivises  effective climate action within a company’s  land-based value chains. The pilots also  ensure that we listen to and discuss with  other stakeholders to create relevant input  to the secretariat for the development of the  guidance. Our ambition is that the guidance  should be transparent, truthful and able to be  implemented"
"In FY21, our methodology to measure going beyond  IKEA was finalised. However, it remained a challenge  to measure and follow up across the IKEA business  in a consistent way. A formal strategic goal will not  be set until one is in place for removing and storing  carbon"
"The larger the contribution from removing and  storing carbon, the smaller the contribution needed  from going beyond IKEA in order to reach the IKEA  commitment to become climate positive. However,  it's important to note that, while no strategic goal has  been set, we're already actively working with actions  that are part of the going beyond IKEA agenda"
"To secure that the actions are connected to the IKEA  business transformation, all actions and activities in  going beyond IKEA are connected to the IKEA value  chain. This means that they are either part of the IKEA  range, supplier base or sourcing area. Any effect of  going beyond IKEA will never act as an offset towards  reaching our emission reduction goal"
"Resource use at home: Solutions that enable the  generation of renewable energy like, for example,  the SOLSTRÅLE home solar offer.1 It also includes  solutions to improve the efficiency of energy- and  water-consuming products, when used as intended"
"One example is the newly launched ÅBÄCKEN water  nozzle, which can enable customers to save up to  95% of water used in taps at home"
"Renewable energy for suppliers: Actions by the  IKEA business to convert our supplier partners to  100% renewable energy for their entire factory or  operations, not just the IKEA share of their business"
Improving forestry and agriculture in IKEA  sourcing areas: Actions by the IKEA business to  improve forests or agricultural practices for the  total surroundings/landscape where we source  raw materials. The possibility to follow up on this  impact will be enabled through the Land Sector and  Removals Guidance by GHG Protocol
"To avoid overestimating the contribution, we're  only accounting for the contribution occurring each  year, instead of adding up the total avoided GHG  emissions that have taken place since baseline FY16"
"This year, we're only disclosing the effect of resource  use at home through the SOLSTRÅLE home solar  offer. Due to the ongoing digitalisation of the  climate footprint reporting, it wasn't possible to  secure quality and consistency in the reported  figures for the non-IKEA part of production"
going beyond IKEA contribution from suppliers will  be followed up on in the next annual climate report
"In FY22, the SOLSTRÅLE home solar offer was  available in 11 IKEA markets.3 The total avoided  emissions through the renewable electricity it  generated was approximately 0.22 million tonnes  CO2 eq (+26% compared to FY21). This is calculated  as the effect of the electricity in the national grid,  which the renewable electricity from home solar  replaces. The average effect is calculated for the  lifetime of the home solar panels, similar to how  the climate footprint for product use at home is  calculated for lighting and appliances"
Millions of tonnes CO2 eq avoided through SOLSTRÅLE Home Solar 1 Available in Ingka Group markets
"2 This excludes lighting, appliances, taps, showers and circular services or solutions since they are already accounted for as GHG emissions in the IKEA climate footprint. Any improvement of these is accounted for in the IKEA climate footprint  (drastically reducing GHG emissions), instead of going beyond IKEA"
"3 In FY22, the SOLSTRÅLE home solar offer was available in the following markets: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland"
Our ambition for 2030 is to regenerate  resources while growing the IKEA business
"We aim to only use responsibly sourced  renewable or recycled materials in our offer  and have a positive impact by regenerating  resources, protecting ecosystems and  improving biodiversity. This also means  working to identify, prevent, mitigate, and  address any potential negative impact on  people linked to our business activities"
"are dependent on materials and ingredients  for our home furnishing offer and food  products, and we will always work to find new  ways to do more with less"
"•  Continue to secure and develop responsible sourcing standards  for raw materials that include environmental, social and animal  welfare criteria"
"•  Continue to be forest positive,1 promoting responsible forest  management to eliminate forest degradation and deforestation  and going beyond our supply chain. Using innovative  approaches to forest management, protection, restoration and  regeneration"
"•  Lead regenerative projects on degraded land, deforested areas  and agriculturally cultivated areas"
•  Become good water stewards by leading and developing water  stewardship programmes. Leading regenerative projects to  clean polluted waters and protect biodiversity. Specifically  focusing on leading projects to clean plastic pollutants from  oceans
"•  Continue to source wood, cotton, food, and other raw materials  from more sustainable sources (supported by credible external  sustainability standards and systems)"
"•  Providing and promoting services, solutions, inspiration  and offering easy access to knowledge to prolong the life of  products and materials. Inviting and enabling customers and  other partners to be part of the solution by making it easy to  acquire, care for, and pass on products"
"1 Forest positive means securing that the wood sourced by our suppliers for IKEA products comes  from more sustainable sources, which we define as FSC-certified or recycled wood. Forest positive  also includes going beyond our own material needs, using our size and strict requirements to  improve the forest industry and make responsible forest management the norm"
chains to secure best practices  for the responsible sourcing of  materials used in our products
"We always strive to take a  holistic perspective, looking  at impacts on both people and  nature"
"In FY22, we prioritised critical materials  within our four raw material blocks (wood,  agriculture, secondary raw materials,  and inorganics) based on the social,  environmental and business risks of  sourcing those raw materials"
"to make progress during FY22: •  Wood: delivered on our requirement  of using only FSC-certified or recycled  wood (we call this wood from more  sustainable sources).2 Approximately  15% of the wood used in IKEA products  came from recycled sources (FY21: 14%),  moving towards our goal of at least  one-third of recycled wood by 2030  (page 28)"
strengthening requirements for all our  agricultural raw materials (page 31)
Inorganics: further explored how to  create transparency in the complex  inorganics supply chains (page 35)
"projects in several markets to  accelerate the capacity build-up for  responsibly sourced recycled materials,  to develop feedstock supply chains as  well as scaling up the use of recycling  technology (page 36)"
Our work to responsibly source raw  materials is continuous and long term
"Working with our suppliers, policymakers,  industry partners, NGOs, experts and  other brands helps to strengthen our  capabilities to improve or change our  supply chains"
"2 We consider a goal to be fully reached when we achieve  more than 98% fulfilment overall. Due to disruptions or new  suppliers/business partners, we can’t guarantee a 100%  fulfilment at every given point in time"
"IKEA supply chains are diverse with  a wide range of different working  conditions, from large-scale  productions for the harvesting  of agricultural products to many  small-scale operations, such as  smallholder farms within both  forestry and agriculture"
"committed to finding ways to  improve working conditions for  everyone in our value chain,  often in partnerships with NGOs,  institutions and other stakeholders  facing similar challenges (page  48). In FY22, we strengthened our  commitments to integrate human  rights practices and due diligence  into our business processes,  decision-making and relationships  (page 41)"
"Wood is the most used material  in the IKEA range.1 It's part of our  identity and Swedish heritage and  includes particle board, fibreboard,  paper-based products and solid  wood"
Approximately 15% of the wood used  in IKEA products is recycled
"In FY22, the amount of wood used in the IKEA business  decreased to 20 million m3 RWE (FY21: 21 million m3  RWE), mainly due to lower sales quantities. 15% of the  wood used in IKEA products is recycled (FY21: 14%)"
"As part of our commitment to drive innovation to  use wood in even smarter ways, we've set a goal to  have at least a third of the wood in the IKEA range be  recycled wood by 2030. As demand for recycled wood  remains high, we've increased actions to close the  remaining gap. We've initiated five projects spanning  several countries to accelerate the capacity build-up  for recycled wood and are working with our partners  and patenting new recycling technologies to increase  recycled wood use (page 36)"
"Due to the war in Ukraine, we have stopped global  purchasing of wood from Russia and Belarus following  Inter IKEA Group's decision to scale down business in  the market"
"Europe remained the main wood-sourcing region for  materials used in IKEA home furnishing products, with  over 80% of all wood use in IKEA products coming from  this continent. However, because of the turbulent times  and rising energy costs, there's increased competition  for wood. We remain committed to sourcing wood from  responsibly managed forests, and we see opportunities  for the development of FSC-certified sources in markets  where forests lack responsible management"
"We reached our goal to only use wood from more  sustainable sources in FY20, and the challenge now is  to secure this level every year going forward. In FY22,  99.9% of total wood used was either FSC-certified or  recycled"
"During FY22, to meet the ambitions set in the IKEA  Forest Positive Agenda 2030, as well as expectations  from IKEA customers and external stakeholders, and  requirements from changing legislation and global  development trends, we completed our sixth revision  of the IWAY Forest Materials Section.3 We've extended  its scope to include more forest materials than  just wood, for example cork, paper, and packaging  material. It's now applicable for forest materials used  across all operations and home furnishing products  (page 49)"
"As the world transitions away from virgin fossil  materials, demand for forest products is also  increasing, adding more pressure on forest resources"
"In addition, hundreds of millions of people rely on  forests for their livelihoods worldwide.4 Responsibly  managed forests can support the livelihoods of people  who depend on forests, safeguard biodiversity and  provide a sustainable wood supply, as well as help  to mitigate climate change by removing and storing  carbon. Read more in the IKEA Climate Report FY22"
"2 To strengthen the way we present our virgin wood use versus our recycled wood  consumption, we are in a process to further develop how we measure and present  these figures. We plan to use a new calculation method from FY23 onwards"
"3 The IWAY Forest Materials Section is part of IWAY, the IKEA supplier code of  conduct (page 48)"
"4 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), ""About forests"", 2022 5 At the beginning of March 2022, Inter IKEA Group and Ingka Group announced the  pausing of IKEA operations in Russia and Belarus. In June, the decision was made  to stop IKEA operations in these countries, and we have been scaling down, step  by step, since that date"
"By 2030, at least 80% of our particle board  will be made of recycled wood"
"Rattan growth study for commercial  species in Indonesia and Vietnam During FY22, the IKEA business used about  6,000 tonnes of dried rattan. During the year,  the IKEA business worked together with the  Center for International Forestry Research  (CIFOR) in Indonesia and WWF in Vietnam  to study annual rattan growth and stock  of selected rattan species in Central and  Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, and in natural  forests in Central Vietnam. The objective of  the study is to estimate sustainable harvest  volume, including harvest intensity and  rotation for selected commercial rattan  species, which could be used as a basis to  define yearly sustainable harvest volume  for rattan species used in IKEA products"
"Furthermore, this knowledge is important  to understand what needs to be developed  to increase the preservation, utilisation and  conservation of genetic resources"
"The IKEA business is moving toward greater  transparency with an industry-first global  wood supply map, sharing where all the  wood material (excluding paper) in IKEA  products came from during FY22, and  more information about why it plays such  an essential role in the range"
"also includes new information about wood  species, regions where it comes from,  volumes and how the IKEA business works  to improve forest management across  different markets. By showing where the  wood in our products comes from, we  want to lead by example and increase  transparency around our wood use"
"29 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 In FY22, together with representatives from  FSC, the IKEA business hosted a meeting in  Estonia for small forest owners from the Baltic  countries and the Czech Republic. For many  years, we've supported small independent  forest owners in Europe to become more  sustainable and achieve FSC certification"
"Because these forestry markets are scattered  and fragmented, this has been a challenge"
"support we offer is not only financial, but also  organisational, bringing many forest owners  together around reducing costs and FSC  certification"
Group certification is one of the easiest and  the most cost-efficient ways for these private  forest owners to achieve FSC certification
is especially important for small forest owners
Another benefit of group FSC certification is  knowledge-sharing among forest owners
Call for urgent climate action at COP27  The IKEA business participated at the  United Nations Climate Change Conference  (COP27) in November 2022 in Egypt
"contributed by engaging in topics such as  what businesses can do to limit climate  change to 1.5°C and protect and enhance  biodiversity, as well as the role responsible  forest management plays in both mitigating  and adapting to climate change, including  the importance of stopping deforestation"
"Since 2002, WWF and the IKEA business have  worked together to protect and manage  natural resources and shape industry  practices. The 20-year partnership began  with projects in forestry before expanding  into cotton, freshwater stewardship and  climate action. Today, the partnership runs  projects in 15 countries and is working to  protect landscapes, enhance biodiversity,  and empower local communities"
"Over the course of the partnership, WWF  and the IKEA business have, for example,  directly supported: FSC certification of more  than 36 million hectares of forests; 400,000  tree plantations to control soil erosion and  retain soil moisture and carbon through  a project in Pakistan; and the creation of  a pathway to improve river health and  biodiversity in Türkiye and India"
to accelerate action to address biodiversity loss
"This included joining over 300 other companies in  calling for mandatory assessment and disclosure  requirements for businesses on how we impact  nature as part of the Business for Nature,  #MakeItMandatory campaign. We participated in  the 15th UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) held  in Montreal in December 2022. We welcome the  positive momentum to this end and agreement  by governments on the Kunming-Montreal Global  Diversity Framework. As was the case for the Paris  Agreement on climate change, we believe that  presenting an ambitious international agreement  will ensure that the nature agenda is raised at the  highest political level"
"We also attended the CBD Open-Ended Working  Group meeting (OEW) in Geneva in March 2022,  demonstrating overall support for the need for  a clear global biodiversity framework that allows  businesses to contribute to its implementation in  a globally harmonised way, in full alignment with  related legislative initiatives. By attending, the IKEA  business also supported the key recommendations  brought forward by Business for Nature"
"And in June 2022, the IKEA business, together  with WWF and H&M Group, hosted a Business and  Biodiversity Action Roundtable for representatives  from 30 companies to explore challenges and  identify solutions for scaling up actions across value  chains, in the context of the Stockholm+50 summit"
The main findings were published as an op-ed in  Business Green and on the WWF website
"As an example of understanding our  impact on biodiversity, all 19 IKEA Industry  locations have been mapped in terms of  their biological importance. In six selected  locations identified as significant in terms  of biodiversity, higher impact biodiversity  activities will be undertaken in FY24"
aim is to broaden impact by improving  biodiversity collaboratively with experts  and other stakeholders in the communities  where IKEA Industry operates
actions that could help support biodiversity
The approach is focused on educating co- workers on the importance of biodiversity  and its protection
"IKEA Industry Kazlu Ruda, Lithuania, tested planting meadows  in the spring of 2022, providing food for pollinators"
"The IKEA business has an impact and  dependency on biodiversity, primarily  through the direct and indirect use of  land, sea, freshwater and raw materials"
"During FY22, we continued the work of  understanding our impact and dependency on  biodiversity across our value chain, from the  forests where we source our wood all the way to  our stores. We’re currently on our way to start the  second step in the Science Based Targets Network  (SBTN) methodology, which means we have a  high-level impact assessment based on generic  data (i.e., not specific to the IKEA business, but  average global industry data). This enables us to  prioritise the collection of data needed to be able  to start setting targets in step three. We’re also,  together with external experts, assessing our  dependency on biodiversity as a way to strengthen  the understanding of biodiversity's relevance to our  business"
We’ve been piloting tools and providing input  connected to the SBTN methodology as part of our  engagement in the SBTN Corporate Engagement  programme
Agricultural raw materials are used  throughout the IKEA offer in food  ingredients and as fibres in home  furnishing products. Cotton is the  main agricultural material for the IKEA  business
"In FY22, the risks associated with conventional  agriculture in the IKEA supply chain were mapped"
"The next step is to set requirements that address  the environmental, social, and animal welfare risks  associated with agriculture and lift and support  the vast number of opportunities to transform our  supply chains towards more regenerative set-ups"
We’re developing a set of holistic and coherent  requirements for all our agricultural raw materials
We’re taking the learnings from this work when  developing the next steps for other raw materials
"For many years, the IKEA business has worked to  develop responsible sourcing practices for some  deforestation-risk commodities, including wood"
"At the same time, we recognise that much of  today's deforestation risks are connected to the  agriculture industry. By the end of 2025, we aim  to ensure the deforestation-risk raw materials  soy, palm oil, beef, leather, coffee, cocoa, rubber  and sugarcane in the IKEA value chain are  deforestation-free. By 2030, we aim to identify and  ensure that other raw materials sourced through  our supply chain don't contribute to deforestation"
"We know it's a big challenge, but by working  with suppliers and international standards and  certifications, we aim to advance the agenda  where we have the most influence"
"Since FY15, the IKEA business only uses virgin  cotton from more sustainable sources (MSS)"
"In FY22, the total volume of cotton in IKEA products,  including non-virgin cotton, was 144,100 tonnes"
"Around 80% of our MSS virgin cotton came from  smallholder farmers and around 20% from large  land-holding farmers. With a focus on reducing the  environmental and social impacts of our cotton  MSS supply chains, we continue to emphasise  physical segregation and end-to-end traceability,  diversification, risk mitigation and promoting  circular cotton supply chains.

The long-term global partnership between the IKEA  business and WWF includes cotton
"We aim to ensure soy,  palm oil, beef, leather,  coffee, cocoa, rubber and  sugarcane in our supply  chain are deforestation- free by 2025"
1 Defined as more sustainable or recycled sources
"Together with local partner Binzhou Nongxi  Cotton Coorporative, the IKEA business  has been conducting a sustainable cotton  farming project in Shandong, China, since  April 2020. As of FY22, the project works  with 8,780 small landholding farmers  across 19,000 hectares of land. The focus  is to optimise the applications of fertilisers  and pesticides in cotton farming, improve  soil and water management practices, and  build awareness about fibre quality"
aim is to help establish a more sustainable  cotton farming practice outside of global  certification programmes and create social  impact by working closely with farming  communities and support additional  sources of incomes by encouraging  diversification of crops with local  commercial value
"Within the ongoing initiative to restore  degraded land, the IKEA business and WWF  launched an initiative to diversify land  use in cotton-growing landscapes in the  southern part of India. Planting fruit trees  like citrus, mango, etc., in degraded areas  provides an alternate source of income  for cotton farmers, as well as enhances  biodiversity and combats soil erosion"
"Approximately 16,000 saplings in 10  hectares have been planted in the past two  years with community support"
"Together with local and industry partners in  Türkiye, the IKEA business has participated  in developing a project to raise awareness  with policymakers on decent working  conditions and employment practices in  cotton fields. The project also addressed  increasing the capacity of major players  in the cotton industry and mobilising  public and social services. The project  has continued in FY22 with outreach to  many more beneficiaries on the ground,  including farmers, farm workers and various  other external stakeholders, as well as  government agencies and policymakers"
"In another initiative during the year, together  with WWF, more than 40,000 farming families  were trained on climate-smart crop production  practices in Pakistan. Climate-smart practices  have enabled farming families to achieve a 23%  reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  in agricultural operations, a 12% improvement  in crop yield, 25% conservation of farm water,  and a 6% increase in organic matter (from  baseline values) through the adoption of soil  health conservation practices in Pakistan"
"The partnership also works with gender  empowerment in India, and has also supported  farming communities in planting trees on  degraded lands – more than 400,000 trees were  planted on 363 hectares"

"During FY22, the IKEA business returned  to a seat on the Better Cotton Council"
"Founded by the IKEA business and other  industry stakeholders, Better Cotton was  officially launched in 2009 with the purpose  of making more sustainable cotton the  industry norm. In the council, together with  like-minded partners, the IKEA business will  play an active role in helping lead the future  direction of Better Cotton by focusing on  global physical traceability implementation,  social and environmental sustainability and  community empowerment"
"The IKEA business is working towards creating  more sustainable food systems, which aligns  with our work in responsible sourcing of raw  materials and our goals for inspiring and  enabling people to live a healthier and more  sustainable life (page 13). Our goal is that all  food ingredients are responsibly sourced"
One way we secure this is through external  sustainability standards systems
1 IKEA Indonesia is operated by the franchisee Dairy Farm
"•  Coffee and cacao: In FY22, we  used 99% Rainforest Alliance- certified coffee (read more) and  68% Rainforest Alliance-certified  cocoa in our range. 100% of IKEA  Brand chocolate tablets are Rain  Forest Alliance certified"
"•  Tea: In FY22, we used 65% UTZ/ Rainforest Alliance-certified and  Fairtrade-certified tea in our  range"
"•  Soy: In FY22, all soy consumed  by animals in our supply chain  was purchased under the Round  Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS)- certification"
"•  Palm oil: In FY22, 88% of the  palm oil used in IKEA food  products was Roundtable on  Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)- certified"
"•  Seafood: In FY22, 98% of our  total seafood volume globally  was Aquaculture Stewardship  Council (ASC)- or Marine  Stewardship Council (MSC)- certified (2020: 91.2%, 2019:  93.7%, 2018: 91%). Read more"
"In addition, several of our products  are certified in accordance with the EU  Organic standards"
"The social enterprises Gora Coffee by Moyee Coffee Ethiopia  and Aneka Coklat in Indonesia are creating livelihoods for  small-scale farmers and factory workers by keeping their  entire production within their country of origin, sourcing  directly for the IKEA Food value chain. Read more"
"Mengandung gluten, susu, telur, ikan, dan kedelai Contains gluten, dairy, egg, fish, and soy IKEA Indonesia1 is the first retail industry in Indonesia to  achieve Chain of Custody (CoC) certification from MSC for  salmon products, as well as the ASC certificate for processed  tilapia fish products"
Good animal welfare is central to our goal of more  sustainable animal agriculture. We’re working to  improve animal welfare through the environments  they’re reared in and the way they’re handled
"Our standards for on-farm practices prioritise  good physical health, good mental health and the  expression of natural behaviour"
The IKEA Food Better Programmes are our  frameworks for more sustainable animal agriculture  in the food supply chain (read more). Each animal  species' programme identifies key responsible  sourcing requirements based on science and  feedback from suppliers and experts
"ambition is that a majority of the IKEA Food Better  Programme requirements will be implemented in  the sourcing of eggs, chicken, pork, beef and dairy  by the end of 2025"
To ensure that animal agriculture contributes to well-functioning ecosystems with improved biodiversity we’re exploring how to move from  conventional to regenerative agriculture practices
•  55% of the chicken volume is sourced  according to IKEA-approved third-party  certifications that cover the majority of  the IKEA Better Chicken requirements
"In FY22, we continued with our Better  Chicken programme and have now  implemented the majority of the  requirements for chicken meatballs in  China, Europe and North America"
•  35% of the pork volume is sourced  according to IKEA-approved third-party  certifications that cover the majority  of the IKEA Better Pig requirements
"free farrowing in North America, i.e. not  confining sows during farrowing and  lactation"
"•  93% of our total egg volume globally  was either free-range or cage-free (the  scope expanded in FY21, adding eggs as  ingredients alongside the earlier scope of  whole eggs, fresh eggs and liquid eggs)"
"In FY22, we continued to explore how  to deploy regenerative agriculture  at farm level and completed a cattle  pre-study and a supplier pilot in North  America. Using regenerative agricultural  principles, the pilot followed the  production of the meatball from grass- fed cattle to utilising the full carcass to  avoid waste, to a tasting session of the  pilot product"
"We’re committed to securing and  upholding animal welfare standards in  the IKEA supply chain, not only when it  comes to food products but also for all  other animal-based materials used in our  range. Wool is one example where the  IKEA business has seen opportunities for  improvement and has for several years  worked to establish full traceability of  the raw material with the aim to achieve  100% responsibly sourced wool by the  end of 2025. We've reached this goal  in New Zealand, which accounts for  approximately 20-25% of the total IKEA  wool consumption. We continue to work  with our suppliers and external partners  to develop new responsible supply  chains in other parts of the world"
"such programme is currently ongoing in  Europe, which we hope will contribute to  another 20-30% of our total needs"
"Together with the NGO Pact, we’ve  investigated how to improve the working  conditions and livelihoods of small-scale  miners. The research shows there are many  opportunities for sustainable development  by improving their source of lighting"
"this small change has demonstrated the  potential for improved health and safety,  reduced environmental impact, waste  reduction, energy self-sufficiency, increased  productivity and income levels"
"Many of the rural small-scale mines that  produce tin, tungsten, and tantalum  found in electronics don't have access  to electricity grids and appropriate head  torches for mining activities aren't currently  affordable nor available to these small- scale miners. Together with Pact, we're  looking into solutions for this that can be  scaled and adopted by local communities  and the wider sector"
"During FY22, we continued to explore how  to create transparency in the complex  inorganics supply chains. Together with  suppliers and sub-suppliers, and other  actors in the sector, the IKEA business is  looking into how traceability of these raw  materials, up to the source of origin, could  be possible to achieve in a realistic and  trustworthy way. These collaborations have  also looked at how to identify and mitigate  risks along the supply chain"
"For example, we’ve been running a project  with the NGO Pact to map the full supply  chain of cobalt for IKEA rechargeable  batteries"
"In FY22, the IKEA business joined the  Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), a  global non-profit standards-setting and  certification organisation, as downstream  supporters to demonstrate the need  for responsibly sourced raw materials"
"As the IKEA business is a small buyer of  aluminium, we need to work together  with organisations such as ASI to make a  significant impact and support the industry- wide change that's needed"
We know that some raw materials don’t currently  have a renewable substitute and the technology  to recycle other raw materials doesn’t yet exist
"also know that the volume of inorganic materials  to recycle is not enough to satisfy the increasing  demand in many cases. That’s why we continue  to be committed to working towards securing  responsibly sourced virgin inorganics, while also  replacing them whenever possible"
"Inorganic raw materials are minerals  used in the production of metals, glass,  ceramics, chemicals and electronic  components"
"While the IKEA business is a relatively small  consumer of inorganic materials on the global  market, these materials are, in many cases, used for  critical applications in the IKEA range. For example,  inorganic raw materials are used in key home  furnishing products such as appliances, lighting,  tableware, and pots and pans. Furthermore, they're  also key components in products designed for  healthy and sustainable living, like air purifiers,  smart home products from IKEA and rechargeable  batteries"
"enormous opportunities to strengthen the  circularity agenda and minimise the waste that,  today, isn't managed responsibly. That’s why we’re  accelerating our efforts to secure responsible  sourcing along our recycled materials value chains"
"In FY22, we continued to navigate the complexities  of sourcing secondary raw materials. To accelerate  our capability to turn pre- and post-consumer waste  into recycled materials for use in IKEA products,  we’ve explored, mapped, and engaged with waste-  sector players in more than 25 markets"
"In FY22, we continued our efforts to  increase the use of recycled materials  (also known as secondary raw materials)  in our products. In FY21, we reported  56% of the materials we sourced were  renewable and 17% were recycled"
We know that the waste sectors in several markets  are partly or wholly unorganised and often  managed in an informal or semi-informal way
"lack of regulation and oversight in these sectors can  lead to mismanagement, which can have a variety  of negative impacts on the environment, people  and local economies"
We’re currently working to implement an  automated data collection tool that will increase  the efficiency and accuracy of our reporting and are  therefore not able to update these figures for FY22
We plan to report figures for FY23
"The world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of post- consumer waste every year, of which only 13"
"is currently recycled.1 These numbers indicate  Together with our development partners, we’ve  continued to explore, identify and develop recycling  technologies. This is to ensure we can, for example,  separate different material components in textiles  and plastics, as well as reuse recycled material for  the same purpose, for example in textile-to-textile  recycling"
"36 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 For many years, the IKEA business has been  working towards the ambition of using only  renewable or recycled materials by FY30. Along the  way, we’ve identified and created roadmaps for all  materials used in IKEA products. We’ve identified  several challenges, such as the need for new  technologies to process waste into new materials"
We’ve identified a range of inorganic materials that  can't yet be replaced with renewable or recycled  materials. And we’ve found that sometimes using  recycled or renewable materials does not only have  a positive impact
"In FY22, we mapped our latest available recycled  and renewable share figures to the key challenges  we face in meeting our 2030 ambition"
"this exercise, it's become clear that meeting our  ambition will not be feasible for certain materials"
"Nevertheless, we’ve decided to keep our ambition  for all materials in order to drive our progress as far  as possible"
"To meet these challenges, we’re working with our  partners to explore new technologies and support  developments within the recycling industry"
also working to secure the chemical safety of our  products (page 39)
We’ve initiated 19 projects in 11 markets to  accelerate the capacity build-up for recycled  materials with the ambition to develop  feedstock supply chains as well as scale  up the use of recycling technology
combining these projects with developing  a responsible sourcing setup aligned with  our Fair & equal agenda that incorporates  the respect for human rights and the social  and working conditions connected to the  collection and sorting of recovered waste  material. Read more about our responsible  business practices on page 41
"At the beginning of 2022, the IKEA business  joined more than 70 leading businesses  and institutions in a call for a legally  binding global treaty on plastic pollution"
"During the United Nations Environment  Assembly (UNEA) meeting in February, a  decision was made to start the work of  establishing a global treaty to achieve  harmonised and global legislation along  the plastics value chain"
"Continuing to increase the share of  recycled polyester in our supply chain  In 2020, we reached the milestone of  90% recycled content in textile products  made of polyester. In FY21, we widened  our measurement scope to include all  polyester and fibre applications, excluding  rigid plastic, but including all fibre-based  applications such as filling in cushions,  duvets, sofas, mattresses and other similar  products"
"In FY22, 88% of the polyester in our supply  chain was recycled. Read more"
"During FY22, we continued to develop  our sourcing from areas where waste  is at a high risk of becoming pollution"
"Through our membership in the Next  Wave Plastics network, we collaborate  with other multinational companies to  build ocean-bound plastic supply chains"
"Here, we’re working closely to improve  the work of certification bodies to ensure  both material content traceability, as well  as improving social and environmental  conditions. The material used in IKEA  products is certified by the OBP Recycling  Certification Subprogram by Zero Plastic  Ocean (ZPO)"
"IKEA Social Entrepreneurship B.V. has  partnered with Saahas Zero Waste in India  to support microentrepreneurs in the  waste sector, to improve livelihoods and  explore opportunities for a transparent  supply of recycled plastics for use in the  IKEA supply chain. Read more"
"In October 2022, the children’s collection BLÅVINGAD was  launched. From soft toys and cushion fillings to rugs and  storage, several of the products in the collection contain recycled  polyester made from ocean-bound plastic (OBP). BLÅVINGAD is  part of a larger movement to include more recycled polyester in  our soft toys range of products"
"The new VALEVÅG mattress contains less foam than its  predecessor, HÖVÅG. It also contains 13% renewable foam,  steel springs with 25% recycled material and both its cover  and wadding are made from recycled polyester"

2 The total water use for FY20 and FY21 has been updated due to  improved quality of data from food suppliers and green plant suppliers
"38 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 Our strategic focus areas consider where we have  the most influence and opportunities for positive  impact: improving water quality and increasing water  availability throughout our value chain, enabling  reduced water consumption in the home, and  demonstrating leadership and collaborating with  others in water stewardship ambitions"
"During FY22, we continued our work with SBTN to  understand and develop a methodology for the target- setting of freshwater. We also initiated the first stages  of the materiality assessment and prioritisation"
"While we’re building an understanding of the  procedures and resources needed for implementing  the SBTN methodology, as an interim approach  we’ve adopted the Contextual Target Setting (CTS)  methodology. With guidance from WWF, CTS has  enabled us to set targets for the production part of the  value chain. After analysing dependency and assessing  risk in production, we’ve identified the most important  river basins linked to our supply chains, based on  current water scarcity"
"One main focus of the IKEA water agenda is the textiles  industry where water management is a key priority,  particularly in water-stressed and water-scarce regions"
We aim to reduce water withdrawals and close the  loop by implementing zero liquid discharge techniques  and processes. We’re working to create awareness in  IKEA business teams and suppliers and have joined a  multistakeholder engagement effort in Bangladesh led  by Business Sweden
"value chains in Türkiye and India During FY22, WWF and the IKEA business  worked with public, private and civil society  partners in the Büyük Menderes basin, Türkiye"
"The work included addressing water risks and  implementing a model of sustainable water use  by improving water efficiency in the agriculture  sector and implementing cleaner production  practices in the textiles sector. In addition, the  partnership is supporting the implementation  of a pilot of regenerative cotton production of  Better Cotton farms, resulting in improved soil  conditions and cotton root development"
"In India, the partnership aims to secure healthy  freshwater ecosystems for Noyyal and Bhavani  rivers. In the initial phase, water challenges and  risks were identified in various zones of both  basins. Based on the findings, science-based pilot  projects are being tested to inform policymakers  and demonstrate better river basin management"
"As part of the programme, WWF-India joined  Tirupur Municipal Corporation to develop an  integrated groundwater management plan  with the goal to design and implement policies  related to river rejuvenation and groundwater  conservation. In 2022, the programme facilitated  development of improvement plans for water and  energy efficiency for seven textile factories in the  river basins, with identified savings of 0.13 million  m3 of water per year"
"One of the main sustainability challenges for textiles is related  to the impacts of dyeing. With BLOMNÄSA, we’re using, for the  first time, synthesised dye from non-edible agricultural or herbal  industry waste such as leaves or nutshells. This dyeing process  requires fewer chemicals and less energy and water"
The TOFTBO bath mat uses no water in the finishing process
"By changing our technique from water treatment to mechanical  treatment, we're saving 30 litres of water per m² of product"
Our ambition is that all  chemicals used in or for making  IKEA products should be safe  throughout their whole lifecycle
Read more about the IKEA view on chemicals
"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)  is a group containing thousands of different  chemical compounds traditionally used in  various consumer products and industrial  applications because of their stain-, oil- and  water-repellent properties. They're often called  “forever chemicals” as they don't dissipate from  the environment. Certain PFASs are known to  be harmful to humans and to the environment  and many lack enough data to show they are  safe. We’ve been working on systematically  phasing out PFAS in our supply chain since  2010. During FY22, we’ve continued the work to  identify further potential uses of PFAS, to add  additional restrictions and phase-out plans"
"During FY22, we continued our decades- long work to reduce formaldehyde  emissions from our products"
in the natural environment. All products  that are made from wood-based materials  and textiles can contain formaldehyde
"High levels of formaldehyde can lead to  negative health effects. We're continuously  working to lower formaldehyde emissions  and are using a stepwise approach to reach  formaldehyde emission levels from wood- based materials that are equal to, or lower  than, levels emitted by natural wood"
The phase-out of formaldehyde in coatings  on paper foils has begun and will finalise by  the end of 2023
"In parallel with the work to increase  the amount of recycled material in IKEA  products (page 36), it’s crucial to secure  chemical safety. During FY22, we continued  risk assessing new recycled materials  before introduction and developed  requirements and processes for control  to avoid the presence of substances of  concern"
is to play our full part  in contributing to a  fair and equal society  by respecting and  promoting human rights  across the value chain  and contributing to  resilient societies

"•  Being a child-friendly business, securing child  safeguarding, family-friendly practices, and inclusion  and empowerment of children and youth"
"In FY22, we revised and strengthened our ambition and  commitments, as reflected in our updated strategy"
"updated social commitments were launched on the first  day of FY23: 1 September 2022. Our updated strategy  is shown here and is reflected in the structure of this  chapter. However, the content of this report is based on  progress made during FY22, when the previous ambition,  commitments and structure were still in place"
"We're placing an increased focus on providing and  promoting living wages and incomes across the value  chain and have also included a commitment to promote  a human-centric approach to our digital touchpoints  and data-driven processes. The revision process has  included a broad range of stakeholders representing  a variety of civil society organisations, NGOs, youth  activists, and UN agencies working to enhance human  rights and social responsibility. We're now in the  process of setting strategic goals to make our social  commitments more operational"
"During the year, we began the work of setting a  Responsible Wage Practices (RWP) baseline within IKEA  operations and throughout the value chain (page 44)"
"We also continued to operationalise the UN Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights, including  developing a business and human rights training for  co-workers and establishing a stronger governance  structure (page 42). In line with the new commitments,  we established a cross-organisational project team to  investigate ways to develop an inclusive and socially  impactful offer that can support us in tackling inequality  through our range and services. We developed a new  training on child safeguarding and strengthened efforts  to tackle child rights risks in deeper supply chains  through a pilot project in the natural fibres supply  chain. During the year, the gender balance improved in  many IKEA organisations (page 46)"
"The war in Ukraine has, in many ways, overshadowed  the year. Our priority has been to secure the health and  safety of our co-workers and the people in our value  chain. We also took immediate action to support people  in Ukraine, engaging with human rights organisations  to provide humanitarian aid to children and their  families, focusing on emergency aid and longer-term  humanitarian support (page 42)"
"The work to play our full part in contributing to a fair  and equal society is ongoing, and we’ll continue to find  ways to strengthen our efforts"
"We’re committed to respecting human rights  throughout our value chain. We continue to take  actions to support vulnerable groups, such as  children and migrant workers. With our reiterated  commitment to tackle inequality, we continue to  develop our human rights due diligence approach  to address our potential negative impacts as  well as strive to achieve positive social impact"

"During FY22, as part of the update of our Fair  & equal focus area in the IKEA sustainability  strategy, we strengthened our commitment  to children and young people, placing  increased emphasis on securing child  safeguarding, inclusion and empowerment of  youth, and family-friendly practices"
"FY23, we'll set new strategic goals to ensure  we reach our strengthened commitments"

"Continuing our efforts to prevent and address  child rights risks in deeper supply chains  During FY22, we stayed focused on our efforts to  prevent and address child rights risks in deeper  supply chains. We’re continuously reviewing our  approach and improving our practices"
"We continued our pilot project focusing on child  rights in the natural fibres supply chain, working  together with The Centre for Child Rights and  Business, an affiliate of Save the Children, which  works with companies to address child rights  issues in supply chains. The pilot project aims  to better understand the risks for and impact  on children in the natural fibres supply chain"
"As previously reported, in FY21, we identified  negative impacts on children working in the  lower tiers of the supply chain. We’ve worked  together with The Centre for Child Rights and  Business to understand the situation and, with  a community-level approach, tackle the root  causes of the issues. We’ve also engaged other  relevant stakeholders to address child rights  issues more broadly and make them aware of  our ambitions, as well as learnings and good  practices from our project. The project will  continue to inform our broader supply chain  management"
"Keeping children safe and protected wherever  and however they interact with the IKEA  business remains a foundational element of our  child rights agenda. Child safeguarding is about  having the right measures in place (policies,  training, guidelines, routines, etc.) to ensure  children who interact with our business are  safe and protected, mitigating and addressing  all risks of harm. During FY22, we took another  step forward in strengthening our child  safeguarding approach by developing an IKEA  training for child safeguarding. The training is  an introduction to the topic and practical guide  for IKEA co-workers who interact with children  in their daily tasks or hold a position that needs  to consider child safeguarding. The training will  be rolled out in FY23"
The IKEA business has committed to tackling  child labour and promoting decent jobs and  learning opportunities for young people
"Following the submission of the Child Labour  Action Pledge, to support the UN initiative that  marked 2021 as the International Year for the  Elimination of Child Labour, we've initiated a  programme to further strengthen the inclusion  of young workers in the IKEA supply chain"
"The first step was to identify where risks to  youth unemployment and lack of educational  opportunities are the highest in connection to  our supply chain. This mapping was conducted  in FY22, and a plan for accelerating the  programme globally was developed"
implementation is planned for FY23
"In FY22, the IKEA business created a children's  collection inspired by the creatures of the  ocean and developed with input from the IKEA  Kids Advisory Panel. Read more"
"We're committed to providing and supporting  decent and meaningful work across the value  chain. This includes efforts to secure responsible  recruitment practices, a just transition to a net- zero and circular economy, stable and predictable  work, and creating and promoting safe, secure and  empowering workplaces. It also includes taking a  holistic approach to responsible wage practices,  putting equal focus on equality at work, pay  principles, competence, dialogue and a living wage"
* Accidents requiring a minimum of one day sick leave
"* Unsafe conditions, unsafe acts and near misses that could  have led to an accident"
In FY22 – using the global framework and  assessment methodology finalised in FY21 – we  continued to work with our holistic approach  to Responsible Wage Practices (RWP)
"conducted the first RWP baseline assessments  throughout organisations working under the  IKEA Brand, and we continued the work to  understand the baseline across our value chain"
"In FY23, we’ll further our work by focusing on  conducting gap analyses and establishing pilot  programmes"
"Given the complexity of securing responsible  wage practices, we’ll continue to actively work  with governments, NGOs, other brands, labour  organisations and specialists to accomplish  more together"
"IKEA Industry is a manufacturer of board material and  wood-based furniture. In FY22, IKEA Industry continued  to work with health and safety as a top priority, with  a specific focus on machine safety, traffic safety,  handling of chemicals and ergonomics"
The involvement of co-workers is a key part of building  a strong safety culture. We aim for all IKEA Industry co- workers to have easy access to incident reporting
"In FY22, 13,000 incidents were reported (FY21: 56,300)"
"One reason for the significant year-on-year decrease  is the learning curve involved with the new digital  reporting system put in place. We're taking learnings  from FY22 and will put a high focus on reporting in  coming years. Another contributing factor to the  decreased figure is that Russian units, some of which  had high co-worker engagement in reporting, are  being phased out of our supply chain and therefore  are no longer included in the scope of our reporting"
"Our goal is for all co-workers to be safe at work  and return home safely every day. In FY22, 134 co- workers were injured and not able to return to work  the following day (FY21: 123). This increase is due to  multiple factors, including the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic, which caused an increase in total working  hours"
"In FY23, we’ll continue our efforts with a focus on  making workplaces safe and building a strong safety  culture to make IKEA Industry safe, every day"
"During FY22, we1 joined the new  initiative by the UN Global Compact that  encourages companies to promote and  provide a living wage as an essential  aspect of decent work. The Think Lab on  Living Wage identifies the steps needed  to scale up the number of companies  making commitments to ensure a living  wage for all workers. Progress around  living wages requires collective work  to influence systemic change across  industries and nations"
"We've participated in a pilot together  with a few other organisations to test the  first ever Road Safety Index, initiated by  Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile  (FIA). The FIA Road Safety Index is a  methodology to assess road safety  performance and calculate the road safety  footprint. An aligned way of measuring  enables benchmarking, learning and  the sharing of best practices. We aim to  implement the FIA Road Safety Index in a  stepwise approach"
"In 2022, we launched Drivers’ Voice – a global  survey for drivers in the IKEA value chain"
"During the launch year, we captured almost  1,000 unique inside perspectives on the  trucking industry worldwide. The results of  the survey enable us to take concrete actions  with stakeholders within and outside the  IKEA business, making sure the unique needs  and challenges faced by drivers can be met"
"Using blockchain to promote fair and ethical  recruitment and employment in Thailand Between August 2020 to August 2021, the  International Organization for Migration  (IOM) and Diginex, an impact technology  company, used blockchain-based technology  to better protect migrant workers at Tat Win  Company Limited (Tat Win), a Thailand-based  IKEA supplier of latex concentrate"
"the project, over 100 migrant workers from  Myanmar employed by Tat Win shared their  recruitment experiences and employment  conditions through Diginex’s mobile app, eMin"
This allowed the company to better understand  the key risk areas and the recruitment and  labour practices in their value chain. Read more  about the project and lessons learned in a PDF  from IOM

1 Through the participation of Inter IKEA Group
"In FY22, we established six new social business  partnerships for creating IKEA products, bringing the  total up to 11 (one new partner is Du Anyam in Indonesia,  pictured above). Our social business product portfolio  continues to grow as our social business partners build  their production capacity and range of materials and  techniques. We launched our first global social business  collection, VÅRDANDE, with 20 products from five social  business partners across Asia. Our partners create a  customer offer with positive social impact while also  increasing the positive effect of our value chain on people  from vulnerable and marginalised groups"
"home furnishing and food products from social business  partners, over 5,200 jobs were created in FY22"
"Despite the continued global COVID-19 pandemic, in FY22,  the volume of social business products sold increased by  4% (compared to FY21) to more than 770,000 pieces"
"IKEA Social Entrepreneurship B.V. continued to run  programmes and make impact investments2 in FY22,  supporting 101 social enterprises – working within  circularity, sustainable agriculture and inclusive  employment – across 26 countries. These programmes  and investments positively impact small-scale farmers  and producers and people distanced from the labour  market due to displacement or disadvantage"
Read more examples of social business partnerships: chocolate in Indonesia and coffee in Ethiopia
"2 Impact investments are investments made in companies, organisations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable beneficial social or  environmental impact alongside a financial return"
"The IKEA business actively works to welcome,  support and protect all dimensions of  diversity in our operations. Our ambition is to  recruit, develop and retain talents to reflect  the demographics of the communities we  operate in. Our aim is to create inclusive work  environments"
"A new strategy for a more inclusive IKEA  In FY22, a new IKEA People Strategy was  introduced, creating a common direction  for all IKEA organisations and IKEA co- workers. One of the three focus areas in the  new strategy is “An inclusive IKEA”, which  puts focus on EDI throughout business  practices"
"Next steps in gender diversity  In FY22, the gender balance improved in  many IKEA organisations. During the fiscal  year, 6 out of 12 franchisees took steps to  increase the number of co-workers who  are women, and 6 out of 12 increased the  number of managers who are women"
"1 These figures are for the largest IKEA franchisee, Ingka Group"
2 Operated by the franchisee Al-Homaizi Group
"46 - IKEA SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FY22 to achieve gender balance at all levels and  in all functions across all IKEA businesses,  including management teams and boards"
"In Ingka Group, 50% of managers and 45%  of CEOs were women in FY22"
also represent approximately half of the  members in the 30 country management  teams
"Many IKEA franchisees are taking specific  actions to improve gender diversity in their  organisations. For example, in FY22, IKEA  Morocco2 launched the Fulfilment Ladies  Class programme in partnership with  Logistics School and Office de la Formation  Professionnelle et de la Promotion du Travail  (OFPPT). The programme has successfully  trained and hired women for operational  jobs at Logistics IKEA Morocco, an area  of the organisation that's traditionally  consisted predominantly of men. Similarly,  in FY22, we increased the number of leaders  who are women in IKEA Kuwait2 to reach  co-worker gender equality (50% women and  50% men)"
"The data shows some progress has been  made towards an equal, diverse and  inclusive IKEA business, but we still have  work to do"
"We're working to expand our view on how to  measure dimensions of diversity, including  gender. Read more about an initiative to  collect diversity data on page 47"
"Taking action to support our  Gender Equal Pay commitment4 In addition to conducting the annual  pay gap assessment, in FY22,  Ingka Group took several concrete  actions to close gender pay gaps"
"These include reviewing the job  offer process, requiring global and  country-level management teams  to annually report on the status of  gender equal pay in their respective  organisations during their board  meetings, and, where local laws  allow, developing gender-neutral  salary principles to support setting  and reviewing salaries"
3 Including IKEA Älmhult and Inter IKEA Group functions
4 The Gender Equal Pay commitment and subsequent actions to support it are undertaken by the IKEA franchisee Ingka Group
"In partnership with the NeuroLeadership  Institute, Ingka Group launched the DECIDE  Unconscious Bias training programme"
"objective of the training is to equip leaders  with the skills to mitigate the influence of  unconscious bias in everyday situations,  thereby creating an environment where  co-workers are comfortable to talk about  biases. Over 2,000 leaders and recruiters  took up the programme in FY22"
"In FY22, as part of ongoing global efforts  around disability inclusion, IKEA became  partners with the NGO Business Disability  Forum (BDF). With support from BDF, we  completed the first global and country  assessments to identify opportunities  for improvement in the areas of diverse  representation, inclusion, and workplace  adjustments for people with disabilities"
We’re using the findings to develop  meaningful solutions and have launched a  global working group to drive actions
"In FY22, Ingka Group conducted a survey  focused on diversity and inclusion"
"38,000 co-workers from 30 countries  participated. The findings show diversity  across the workforce. However there are  opportunities to strengthen the inclusion  of under-represented identity aspects,  such as certain ethnicities, disabilities, and  sexual orientations"
"In FY22, IKEA launched the first  products from a partnership  with Saitex, a social business in  Vietnam. Saitex actively recruits and  trains youth from disadvantaged  backgrounds and persons with  disabilities. It also adapts the  industrial production set-up to suit  people with different needs and  educates employees about the  variety of needs on-site"
"IWAY – the IKEA supplier code of conduct IWAY is the IKEA way of responsibly  procuring products, services, materials  and components and is a complete  sustainability system for working  together with all suppliers throughout  our value chain.1 It’s the IKEA supplier  code of conduct and a development  programme for supplier sustainability  practices"
"The objectives of IWAY are to ensure decent and  meaningful work, promote a positive impact on the  environment, secure children’s rights, and improve  the welfare of animals in the IKEA value chain"
IWAY is based on open dialogue and long-term  relationships with our suppliers
"During FY22, we placed more emphasis on  strengthening the dialogue with our suppliers  on topics such as biodiversity, working hours,  fundamental labour rights and responsible  recruitment of migrant workers"
"workers are a vulnerable group of workers in the  value chain, and during FY22, we've seen new  complex corridors of migration arising, where  the risks of exploitation are increased. To secure  compliance with IWAY requirements on responsible  recruitment of migrant workers, we'll continue to  focus on this topic during FY23"
"During the year, we continued the work of  integrating the revised and updated version of  IWAY – IWAY 6, introduced in September 2020 –  across the value chain. Read more"
"While IWAY 6 puts a bigger focus on supporting  our suppliers with their continuous development  journey, compliance with mandatory IWAY  requirements is, and remains, the foundation of  our partnership with suppliers. For example, in  FY22, more than 1,100 verification activities were  performed in the Inter IKEA Group supply chain"
They include gap assessments for new suppliers  and full or focused audits for existing suppliers
"With a stronger focus on supporting suppliers with  the implementation of IWAY, in FY22, we offered  more than 1,000 implementation support activities  in parts of the IKEA value chain. These activities  included capacity-building and training on topics  including internal audit skills, health and safety  trainings, responsible recruitment and more"
continue to improve and strengthen our ways  of working in the IWAY System with competence  development of our suppliers
The biggest home furnishing purchasing region in terms  of volumes is Europe. We believe in building long-term  relationships with our suppliers and place a strong  emphasis on supplier development. The average length of  collaboration with our home furnishing suppliers is 11 years
"We try to understand the specific local contexts and take a  consistent and risk-based approach to securing good social,  environmental and working conditions"
"1 The total number of suppliers working with IWAY (for Inter IKEA Group, Ingka Group and Falabella) is around 10,300"
"The IKEA business uses forest materials in  a wide range of products, from wooden  furniture and accessories to natural fibre-  and wood-based textile products"
"also use forest materials in packaging,  communication material, and other  products that support the running of IKEA- owned operations"
"Forestry requirements have been in place  in IWAY since the first edition launched in  2000. During FY22, these requirements  were revised in line with the IKEA Forest  Positive Agenda for 2030 and new  legislation. Read more"
"The IWAY Forest Materials Section is now  applicable for all IKEA suppliers using  forest materials for the IKEA business,  for example, home furnishing products,  packaging, communication materials  and others. Requirements in the IWAY  Forest Materials Section include assessing  and mitigating risks related to illegal  harvesting and trade of forest materials,  sourcing forest materials from more  sustainable sources, contributing to the  IKEA climate agenda and the efficient  use of natural resources. We'll start  introducing the IWAY Forest Materials  Section to suppliers in FY23"
"In FY22, we started to implement IWAY  requirements for responsible sourcing in  parts of our forest material supply chains  by involving all sub-contractors handling  forest materials from the forest roadside to  IKEA supplier sites, such as wood processing  companies, warehouses, traders, transport  companies, etc. For implementation, we're  following a stepwise approach. As a first step,  together with our suppliers, we aim to secure  compliance and close gaps to the minimum  IWAY Must1 requirements and address  challenges such as complex and long supply  chains and lack of openness, transparency and  competence further in supply chains. This work  has started with solid wood supply chains and  board materials, and we'll take these learnings  to supply chains of other raw materials"
1 Read more about the IWAY Must and IWAY Basic requirements here
"During FY22, we started to introduce  requirements from the new IWAY Digital  Platform Work Section to suppliers. The IWAY  Digital Platform Work Section defines the  minimum social and working conditions for all  digital platform workers who perform services  for, or on behalf of, the IKEA business"
The development of new technology has  created conditions for digital platform work  to expand exponentially in the past few years
"Digital platform workers carry out, either online  or on location, short-term tasks or services  available for selection through a platform"
"Some of these tasks include customer delivery  and installation services. Digital platform  workers operate independently and don't have  an employment relationship with suppliers,  service providers or platforms. Our ambition is  to support decent and meaningful work for all  digital platform workers in the IKEA value chain"
"Legislation around labour conditions and  social protection for digital platform workers  remains lacking in most countries, and the  situation is rapidly changing. In the European  Union, a proposal for a directive on improving  working conditions in platform work is under  discussion. With the IWAY Digital Platform Work  Section, our aim is to have a dialogue around  the social and working conditions of platform  workers, take learnings from implementing  the section requirements in our value chain,  and move this topic step by step together with  the relevant stakeholders and partners for the  benefit of all digital platform workers in the  IKEA value chain"
"One of the success factors for suppliers  to secure compliance with the IWAY  requirements is their own internal auditing  process. To support our suppliers in East  Asia, the local IKEA teams have been  focusing on competence development,  organising trainings on auditing skills and  developing a toolbox for suppliers' internal  audits. They also established a reporting  channel to help suppliers identify, discuss  and address emerging challenges together  with the IKEA teams"
"With these approaches, suppliers can  proactively identify emerging issues,  find solutions to issues at an early stage  together with the IKEA business when  needed, build a stronger collaboration,  and have a more open and constructive  dialogue. As a result, over the last year, the  number of identified critical deviations of  IWAY requirements during independent  audits decreased by more than half"
"During the IWAY audits and verification activities  performed in FY22, no suspected or confirmed  cases of child labour were identified. We are closely  monitoring this at all our suppliers. We are also  continuing to work to prevent and address child  rights risks in deeper supply chains (page 43)"
"Insufficient systems for working hours  registration, including overtime, were found  at 13 suppliers"
Non-compliance to the accident insurance  requirement was identified at seven  suppliers. The accident insurance  requirement was strengthened in IWAY 6  and now includes occupational illnesses
"Including illnesses is new in some regions,  which has led to non-conformities, despite  implementation support to suppliers"
"Like all IWAY deviations, we take these very  seriously and are following the IWAY process of  identifying root causes to the issues, securing  that suppliers implement corrective actions, and  phasing out suppliers who don't address the  issues in a reliable and consistent way"
"FY22, we've phased out nine suppliers due to IWAY  non-compliance"
"1 To create one competence centre for purchasing the supply of raw materials and components, as of 1 September 2021, the purchase of direct  material for IKEA owned factories of IKEA Industry is led from IKEA Components"
2 The table does not include local suppliers to IKEA franchisees
3 Some suppliers and service providers have multiple production and service units. IWAY applies on unit level
4 No air freight is used for our product transport
5 This figure doesn’t include digital suppliers
6 The FY21 result is lower compared to FY20 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on audits at sub-contractors where many verification  activities were reduced or put on hold due to worldwide travel restrictions
"components, provide food for our restaurants,  and supply essential services to IKEA companies"
"•  Customers: In order to live up to the IKEA vision  of creating a better everyday life for the many  people, we need to understand the needs of  our customers. The IKEA business engages with  customers in many ways, such as in stores, online,  by visiting them at home and via IKEA FAMILY"
"Each year, IKEA co-workers conduct thousands  of home visits around the world. The data and  insights collected are used in the development of  IKEA products and services. Since 2016, we've also  conducted an annual global survey about life at  home around the world.1 The results are published  in the Life at Home Report"
•  Partners and collaborators: IKEA partners and  collaborates with many external organisations  that are committed to tackling large and complex  global sustainability challenges that both impact  and are impacted by the IKEA business
"partners and collaborators include businesses,  governments, universities and NGOs"
An essential part of reaching the IKEA sustainability  goals is working together with others. It’s important  to develop strong and meaningful relationships
"When we work together, we can drive and support  change, learn, inspire each other and find the best  solutions. Our key stakeholder groups are: •  Co-workers: The 231,000 IKEA co-workers from  around the world share a special set of values and  a vision to enable people to live a better, more  sustainable everyday life. They come together in  diverse, inclusive and open IKEA environments,  where each can offer something unique. Every co- worker plays a role in creating a better business"
"•  Communities: We engage in the communities  where we operate to learn and share ideas  while working collaboratively to create positive  impacts on the environment, livelihoods and local  economy"
"•  Suppliers and partners: Working with over  1,600 direct suppliers and service providers in  the areas of transport, logistics and distribution  services, components, and food to minimise the  environmental footprint of the total IKEA supply  chain and beyond, while improving working  conditions. There are millions of workers who,  through our suppliers and service providers,  source, make and transport our products and  1 Through Ingka Group"

Visit our stakeholder engagement webpage for  more details
Sustainability is an integrated part of our business  and is led from a holistic perspective with an aligned  overall direction. Each part of the IKEA business  contributes to the total IKEA sustainability agenda
"The total IKEA sustainability direction (ambitions and  commitments) is set by the Strategic Sustainability  Council, chaired by the CEO of Inter IKEA Group"
"comprises representatives from Inter IKEA Group  and the franchisees to ensure alignment across  the IKEA franchise system while respecting the  independence of the companies in the IKEA franchise  system. Managing directors of the Inter IKEA  Group are members and the managing directors  of selected franchisees are invitees, together with  sustainability managers from both Inter IKEA Group  and franchisees"
"Sustainability working groups, with experts from  Inter IKEA Group and franchisees, discuss and align  strategic initiatives to fulfil the IKEA sustainability  strategy"
Inter IKEA Group sustainability management Inter IKEA Group sustainability management  is responsible for aligning and developing  sustainability ambitions and commitments and  reporting on performance. The group also provides  recommendations on strategic business decisions  with environmental and social impacts and prepares  content and decisions for the Strategic Sustainability  Council
"The Inter IKEA Group Code of Conduct, introduced in  2016, is undergoing a revision, which is expected to be  launched in FY23. It will be accompanied with wider  communication on ethics. The objective is to foster  an ethical workplace and to stimulate dialogues on  ethical dilemmas"
"In FY22, the existing ""Introduction to Inter IKEA Group  Code of Conduct"" workshops were redesigned to a  blended form to reach the many new co-workers"
"brand new ""Refresher to the Inter IKEA Group Code  of Conduct"" online learning was introduced for co- workers with more than two years in Inter IKEA Group  companies. Both learning solutions are mandatory"
"More than 1,500 participants completed the trainings  since their introduction in June 2022"
"The IKEA business promotes a culture of  inclusiveness, and everyone is encouraged and  should feel empowered to come forward and raise  any concerns they might have. Inter IKEA Group offers  different options to raise concerns via our feedback  culture, either by addressing the situation to the  person directly – a manager or a People & Culture  colleague or by reaching out to the Raise a Concern  platform"
"In FY22, 91 concerns related to Inter IKEA Group were  reported, an increase of 21% compared to FY21, when  75 concerns were reported. The increase can partly  be attributed to the opening of the Raise a Concern  platform externally. The majority of the concerns  were reported in the supply operations, which have  the most co-workers. Most cases reported concerned  either HR or business ethics related topics (e.g.,  harassment, discrimination, leadership behaviour,  conflict of interest and bribery). 47% of the concerns  raised were found to be (partly) substantiated,  leading to different disciplinary actions and process  improvements"
"In FY22, a new Raise a Concern platform was designed  and procedures were updated. In FY23, this new  platform will be launched and there will be enhanced  communication activities to raise awareness on how  and where to raise concerns within Inter IKEA Group"
"Additionally, a tailored training plan for persons  involved in handling concerns is being developed and  will also be implemented in FY23"
"Inter IKEA Group is committed to operating a  sustainable business with respect for human rights  and ensuring fair and safe working conditions in  our value chain. Our supplier code of conduct, IWAY,  explains our expectations towards our business  partners thereon. One of the requirements in IWAY is  that our business partners should have a grievance  mechanism in place for their workers. In FY22,  Inter IKEA Group started exploring the possibilities  to set up a grievance mechanism for their supply  chain so that workers can also reach out to IKEA to  raise concerns, as a last resort. We aim to fulfil our  commitments to engage stakeholders and provide  means by which people can bring serious non- compliance issues with IWAY to our attention"
"FY23, in selected markets, Inter IKEA Group will pilot a  grievance mechanism for workers in the supply chain"
"The IKEA Sustainability Report and the Climate Report  summarise the combined performance of companies  operating under IKEA franchise system and/or in the  IKEA value chain. These reports do not address any  formal reporting requirement that may be applicable  to companies covered in the report. Inter IKEA Group  will report under the EU Corporate Sustainability  Reporting Directive when applicable in FY26, for which  preparations are ongoing"
"For tax and financial compliance-related reporting,  please refer to company-specific reports. Inter IKEA  Group publishes its reports on Inter.IKEA.com. IKEA franchisees often issue their own reports,  which may include both the IKEA business and other  businesses. Please refer to these reports for more  detailed information about each franchisee"
